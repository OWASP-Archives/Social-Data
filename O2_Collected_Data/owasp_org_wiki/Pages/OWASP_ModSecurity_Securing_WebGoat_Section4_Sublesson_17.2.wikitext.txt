17. Web Services -> 17.2 WSDL Scanning

(This sublesson was not formally solved by the project)

=== Lesson overview ===

The WebGoat lesson overview is included with the WebGoat lesson solution.

=== Lesson solution === 

Refer to the zip file with the WebGoat lesson solutions. See Appendix A for more information. 

=== Strategy ===

This WebGoat lesson demonstrates WSDL Scanning to get credit card information. The vulnerability is that the attacker can call a Web Service directly; in this case, it is 'getCreditCard'. The attacker retrieves the WSDL, observes the parameters of a normal request 'id=101&SUBMIT=Submit', then intercepts and manipulates the parameters to call the function directly: 'id=101&field=getCreditCard&SUBMIT=Submit'

A ModSecurity solution is straightforward: don't allow a user to directly call a specific set of Web Services - in our case 'getCreditCard' - by blocking on the request if that value for the 'field' parameter appears.

=== Implementation ===
