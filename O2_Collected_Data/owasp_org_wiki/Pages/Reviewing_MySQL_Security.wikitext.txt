==Introduction==

As part of the code review, you may need to step outside the code review box to assess the security of a database such as MySQL. The following covers areas which could be looked at.

===Privileges===
'''Grant_priv''': Allows users to grant privileges to other users. This should be appropriately restricted to the DBA and Data (Table) owners. 
 
 Select * from user 
 where Grant_priv = 'Y'; 
 
 Select * from db 
 where Grant_priv = 'Y';
 
 Select * from host 
 where Grant_priv = 'Y';
 
 Select * from tables_priv
 where Table_priv = 'Grant';

'''Alter_priv''': Determine who has access to make changes to the database structure (alter privilege) at a global, database, and table level. 

 Select * from user 
 where Alter_priv = 'Y';
 
 Select * from db 
 where Alter _priv = 'Y';
 
 Select * from host
 where Alter_priv = 'Y';
 
 Select * from tables_priv
 where Table_priv = 'Alter';

====MySQL Configuration File====

Check for the following:

 a) skip-grant-tables
 b) safe-show-database
 c) safe-user-create

'''a)''' This option causes the server not to use the privilege system at all. All users have full access to all tables.

'''b)''' When the '''SHOW DATABASES''' command is executed, it returns only those databases for which the user has some kind of privilege. Default since MySQL v4.0.2.

'''c)''' With this enabled a user can't create new users with the GRANT command as long as the user does not have the '''INSERT''' privilege for the '''mysql.user table'''.

====User Privileges====
Here we can check which users have access to perform potentially malicious actions on the database. "Least privilege" is the key point here: 

 Select * from user where 
 Select_priv  = 'Y' or Insert_priv  = 'Y'
 or Update_priv = 'Y' or Delete_priv  = 'Y'
 or Create_priv = 'Y' or Drop_priv    = 'Y'
 or Reload_priv = 'Y' or Shutdown_priv = 'Y'
 or Process_priv = 'Y' or File_priv    = 'Y'
 or Grant_priv   = 'Y' or References_priv = ‘Y'
 or Index_priv = 'Y' or Alter_priv = 'Y';

 Select * from host 
 where Select_priv  = 'Y' or Insert_priv  = 'Y'
 or Create_priv = 'Y' or Drop_priv    = 'Y'
 or Index_priv = 'Y' or Alter_priv = 'Y'; 
 or Grant_priv   = 'Y' or References_priv = ‘Y'
 or Update_priv = 'Y' or Delete_priv  = 'Y'

 Select * from db 
 where Select_priv  = 'Y' or Insert_priv  = 'Y'
 or Grant_priv   = 'Y' or References_priv = ‘Y'
 or Update_priv = 'Y' or Delete_priv  = 'Y'
 or Create_priv = 'Y' or Drop_priv    = 'Y'
 or Index_priv = 'Y' or Alter_priv = 'Y';

===Default MySQL Accounts===
The default account in MySQL is "root"/"root@localhost" with a blank password. We can check if the root account exists by: 

 SELECT User, Host 
 FROM user
 WHERE User = 'root';

===Remote Access===
MySQL by default listens on port 3306. If the app server is on localhost also, we can disable this port by adding
'''skip-networking''' to the [mysqld] in the my.cnf file.
