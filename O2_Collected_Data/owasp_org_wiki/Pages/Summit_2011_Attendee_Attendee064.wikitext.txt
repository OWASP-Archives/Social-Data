It's difficult to describe my knowledge in the security world without being subjective, hence replace some by whatever your feel happy with. The official title on the v-card will be senior security and network consultant, which means something too. 
(Short) CV 
I'm doing software development since early '80s, used to networking all the time, and focused on web application security starting this millenium. Meanwhile I've seen coming, have evaluated, have configured and used, and have seen disappearing a lot of WAFs and web application security scanners. Founded sic[!]sec GmbH in 2010.
