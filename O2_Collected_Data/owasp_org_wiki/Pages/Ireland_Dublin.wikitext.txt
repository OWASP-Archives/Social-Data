*'''Overview & Goal'''
**Apart from OWASP's Top 10, most OWASP Projects are not widely used and understood. In most cases this is not due to lack of quality and usefulness of those Document & Tool projects, but due to a lack of understanding of where they fit in an Enterprise's security ecosystem or in the Web Application Development Life-cycle. 
**This course aims to change that by providing a selection of mature and enterprise ready projects together with practical examples of how to use them. 
**The course will be very practical where demonstration and hands-on exercises will be provided for the tools covered. 
**If you are interested in participating in the hands on portion of the course, please bring a laptop.

'''Title:''' OWASP ESAPI Swingset: Introduction & Demo by Cathal Courtney
<br>
'''Abstract:''' The ESAPI Swingset is a web application which demonstrates common security vulnerabilities and asks users to secure the application against these vulnerabilities using the ESAPI library. The application is intended for Java Developers. The goal of the application is to teach developers about the functionality of the ESAPI library and give users a practical understanding of how it can be used to protect web applications against common security vulnerabilities. During the talk, Cathal will demonstrate how to install and use ESAPI Swingset in your organization. A copy of the latest version will be also provided to the attendees.
<br>
'''Presenter:''' Cathal is an experienced developer working at AIB and is currently the ESAPI Swingset project leader. More information about this project could be found here: [http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ESAPI_Swingset Esapi SwingSet]

'''Title:''' Security Implications for Web Applications based on SOA by John Marmelstein
<br>
'''Abstract:''' The main point of SOA (in this context) is combining systems and applications to make new applications, or a big 'overall' application.This higher inter-operability does (by default) lower security. For a start, a request originating from a web user might end up at several back end systems, which do not know who or what the request came from.
<br>
Each back end system might have no access to the customer data, have a different security models, and serve serveral front end. Each of the above systems could be under different ownership, thus the owners have different concerns and priorities. Also, the basic solution at a technical level include single sign on, or security as a service. This can be costly, give limited coverage and have a performance hit. But is pretty much the only way to do it. The other thing to do (probably in tandem) is strict management, and delegation of authority.
<br>
'''Presenter:''' John has about 13 years in IT. Most of this in distributed systems and 'Middleware' integration software. Including BEA (now owned by Oracle). Mainly working on Enterprise Java and more recently on Microsoft BizTalk. Various industries, incuding financials, public services, and a fish farm.

== OWASP Ireland Event - What is the O2 Platform?  ==

'''When:''' 19/2/2010 3:00pm - 5:00pm <br>

'''Where:''' Ernst &amp; Young, Harcourt Street, Dublin 2, Opposite the Odeon Pub, Dublin, Ireland 

'''Sponsors:''' [[Image:Ey logo.gif]]<br>

'''Title:''' OWASP O2 Platform - Open Platform for automating application security knowledge and workflows <br>'''Abstract:''' In this talk Dinis Cruz will show the OWASP O2 Platform which is an open source toolkit specifically designed for developers and security consultants to be able to perform quick, effective and thorough 'source-code-driven' application security reviews. The OWASP O2 Platform (http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_O2_Platform) consumes results from the scanning engines from Ounce Labs, Microsoft's CAT.NET tool, FindBugs, CodeCrawler and AppScan DE, and also provides limited support for Fortify and OWASP WebScarab dumps. In the past, there has been a very healthy skepticism on the usability of Source Code analysis engines to find commonly found vulnerablities in real world applications. This presentation will show that with some creative and powerful tools, it IS possible to use O2 to discover those issues. This presentation will also show O2's advanced support for Struts and Spring MVC. 

'''Presenter:''' Dinis Cruz is a Security Consultant based in London (UK) and specialized in: ASP.NET/J2EE Application Security, Application Security audits and .NET Security Curriculum Development. For the past years Dinis has focused on the field of Static Source Code analysis, from May 2007 to Dec 2009 he worked as a independent consultant for Ounce Labs (bought by IBM in July 2009) where during active security engagements using Ounce's technology he developed the Open Source codebase which now is the foundation of the OWASP O2 Platform. Dinis is currently focused on making the O2 Platform the industry standard for consuming, instrumenting and data-sharing between the multiple WebAppSec tools, the Security consultants and the final developers. Dinis is a also active trainer on .Net security having written and delivered courses for IOActive, Foundstone, Intense School and KPMG (at multiple locations including BlackHat), and has delivered a number of presentations and keynote speeches at multiple OWASP and Security related conferences. At OWASP, Dinis is the leader of the [[OWASP O2 Platform]] project, member of the OWASP [[Global Projects Committee]], chair of the [[OWASP Connections Committee]] and member of the [[About The Open Web Application Security Project#Global_Board_Members|OWASP Board]].

'''When:''' 20/5/2010 6:30pm - 7:30pm <br>

'''Where:''' Ernst &amp; Young, Harcourt Street, Dublin 2, Opposite the Odeon Pub, Dublin, Ireland 

'''Sponsors:''' [[Image:Ey logo.gif]]<br>

'''Title:''' Trials &amp; Tribulations of WAF Implementation<br>'''Abstract:''' A web application firewall (WAF) is an appliance, server plugin, or filter that applies a set of rules to an HTTP conversation. Generally, these rules cover common attacks such as Cross-site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection. By customizing the rules to your application, many attacks can be identified and blocked. The effort to perform this customization can be significant and needs to be maintained as the application is modified.<br>Mark will be presenting on his experience in implementing a Web Application Firewall solution through all phases from research to implementation. 

'''Presenters:'''

== OWASP Event: Define Security Requirements - A practical approach  ==

'''When:''' 20/5/2010 6:30pm - 7:30pm <br>

'''Where:''' Ernst &amp; Young, Harcourt Street, Dublin 2, Opposite the Odeon Pub, Dublin, Ireland 

'''Sponsors:''' [[Image:Ey logo.gif]]<br>

'''Title:''' Define Security Requirements - A practical approach<br>'''Abstract:''' The Data Protection Act states that "appropriate security measures" must be taken to protect personal data. How do you specify the appropriate security measures for a website which processes personal data? It is an important step in a development project, but is often neglected. In this talk, Alexis will descibe his own experiences of assessing web application, and will also look in more detail at what the Data Protection Commissioner says. He will then take a fictional website and look at a practical approach to specifying the security requirements that the fictional application should meet. This will use the kind of risk-based techniques outlined by OWASP or the Microsoft Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL). Issues discussed will include encryption, authentication, access control, audit, etc. The result will be a list of security requirements that can be carried into the design and development phases. Attendees should be able to apply the ideas to their own development projects. 

'''Presenters:''' 

'''Alexis Fitzgerald - Rits Information Security Group''' <br>For the last six years Alexis has worked for Rits Information Security Group, where he performs application penetration testing assignments as well as advising clients on application security issues. Before that, he spent many years as a developer (mainly in the financial sector), and he continues to be involved in development. Alexis holds an MSc in Information Security from the University of London, Royal Holloway.<br>
