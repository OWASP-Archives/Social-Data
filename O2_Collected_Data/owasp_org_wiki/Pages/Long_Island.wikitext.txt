'''September'''
*Date: Thursday, September 22, 2011 
*Time: 6:30pm - 9:30pm 
*Location: University Club Facility at David Mack Hall, Hosftra University, Hempstead, NY 11549-1000 
*Topics & Speakers: <br>
'''Helen Gao - [https://www.owasp.org/images/c/c3/OWASPTop10XSSLongIsland.pdf Cross-site scripting], the most prevalent. Web application vulnerability:''' <br>
Helen will discuss one of the most widespread Web application Vulnerabilities.  How can an application be attacked and how to protect yourself.

<br>
'''About the Speaker -''' Helen Gao has worked in the field of information security since 1991. Helen has worked as an application developer, project manager, and software architect. Her employment history includes working at a financial institution, a market research company, a high-tech device manufacturer and a software company.  Helen is currently a senior architect at TIBCO Software Inc. Her job duties include the design and development of complex event processing software. The protection of information security in such systems is challenging, due to their strict performance requirements in terms of high event throughput and low processing latency. Helen welcomes the challenge and uses the knowledge she obtained from OWASP to manage project life cycles.



'''Round Table Discussions Coordinated by Ryan Behan:''' <br>
Topics - 
Recent Attack on Infraguard Website.
Security as a Service Model vs. Internally Managed Security -Five years from now, what will IT look like? 
LulzSec, Anonymous, A-Team - Motivations for attacks?  How do small-medium size businesses protect themselves from this?  Insurance, increased IT budgets?
<br><br>
'''About the Speaker -''' Ryan Behan is the Director of Internal IT at Netsmart Technologies Inc.  He is a strong proponent of information sharing, application security and improving business agility through automation and scalable infrastructure. 




'''May'''
*Date: Saturday, May 14, 2011 
*Time: 12:30pm - 3:30pm 
*Location: Student Center, Hosftra University, Hempstead, NY 11549-1000 
*Topics & Speakers: <br>
<br>Robert Gezelter - <br>
'''Minimum Necessary Implementation: Reducing Attack Surface increase Security''' <br>
Ensuring the security and integrity of web-based applications is a constant challenge. Web-based applications are inherently customer-facing, and an attractive avenue of attack. However, vulnerability is often unnecessarily increased by poor technology choices. Different technologies have different degrees of vulnerability. ActiveX creates a higher exposure than Java or JavaScript, which in turn has more potential for abuse than simple CSS.  Some approaches (e.g., unguarded SQL queries) are particularly vulnerable to attack (e.g., SQL injection); other approaches unnecessarily create exposures by requiring unrestricted trust (e.g., ActiveX). <br>
Judicious division of responsibilities between clients and servers is another aspect of the same problem, as clients are inherently less-trustable than servers.
We will examine how using the minimum necessary technology reduces attack surface, decreases vulnerabilities, and decreases costs. <br><br>
About the speaker - Mr. Gezelter has more than 30 years of international consulting experience on architectures, protocols, and implementation techniques in both the private and public sectors.  He has spoken widely at conferences throughout the United States and internationally.  He has also  published numerous technical papers and book chapters, including two chapters in the Computer Security Handbook, 5th Edition and two chapters in the Handbook of Information Security. He also publishes Ruminations - An IT Blog on a variety of topics relating to Information Technology and systems architect <br>

'''Intro to the OWASP Mobile Project''' 

The OWASP Mobile Project is in its infancy, but has generated a lot of interest in the security and mobile development communities. Recently, delegates at the OWASP Summit in Portugal started laying the ground work to help guide the project through its inaugural year. One of the objectives for this year will be to ratify the current, unofficial OWASP Mobile Top 10 List. This presentation will do a deep dive into the current list, citing real world examples of insecure mobile applications.

'''The Exploit Intelligence Project''' 

In 2011, mass malware is still the most common source of compromise on corporate networks. Bots like Zeus, Gozi, and Clampi successfully infect devices despite organizations carefully managing disclosed vulnerabilities and subscribing to detailed analysis of the latest malware families. Existing efforts at malware prevention focus broadly on vulnerabilities and their impact yet ignore the means by which they are exploited and the motivations, opportunities and capabilities of attackers, which has allowed this problem to become worse year-after-year. 

In this talk, I introduce an intelligence-driven approach to malware defense, focusing on attacker's capabilities and methods, with data collected from the most popular crimeware packs currently deployed in-the-wild. This analysis identifies the means by which exploits are developed and selected for inclusion in crimeware packs, identifies defenses that are outside the capability of malware exploit writers to bypass, and helps attendees evaluate not just the exploitability, but the probability of a vulnerability being exploited. This study shows that, until crimeware packs substantially advance in sophistication, only a few simple defensive tactics are required to protect users from such opportunistic threats.

'''[http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebScarab_Project WebScarab] Demo / Web Vulnerabilities Intro''' WebScarab is a framework for analysing applications that communicate using the HTTP and HTTPS protocols. It is written in Java, and is thus portable to many platforms. WebScarab has several modes of operation, implemented by a number of plugins. In its most common usage, WebScarab operates as an intercepting proxy, allowing the operator to review and modify requests created by the browser before they are sent to the server, and to review and modify responses returned from the server before they are received by the browser. WebScarab is able to intercept both HTTP and HTTPS communication. The operator can also review the conversations (requests and responses) that have passed through WebScarab. 

In this demo we'll use WebScarab against some emulated vulnerabilities developed by Blake Cornell.
