==Description==

The program calls a thread's run() method instead of calling start().

In most cases a direct call to a Thread object's run() method is a bug. The programmer intended to begin a new thread of control, but accidentally called run() instead of start(), so the run() method will execute in the caller's thread of control.

==Risk Factors==
TBD

==Examples ==

The following excerpt from a Java program mistakenly calls run() instead of start().

    Thread thr = new Thread() {
      public void run() {
        ...
      } 
    };
    thr.run();
