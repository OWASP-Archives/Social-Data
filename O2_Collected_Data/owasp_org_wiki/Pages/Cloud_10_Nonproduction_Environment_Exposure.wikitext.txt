An IT organization that develops software applications internally
employs a set of non-production environments for design, development,
and test activities. The non-production environments are generally not
secured to the same extent as the production environment. This is to
ease and facilitate the development and test cycles. Such
non-production environments are not only accessed by the employees of
the organization, but also by the outsourced vendors. In a non-cloud
environment, the non-production environments are in the data-center of
the organization, and are under complete ownership of the organization.
Therefore, the organization can appropriately control the access of these
environments.

If an organization chooses to use a cloud provider for a
non-production environment, then the organization loses control over
them. Since cloud is publicly accessible, there is a high risk that an
unauthorized user may get access to the non-production environment. A
malicious user may alter the environment in such a way that it becomes
unusable. Or even worse, a malicious user may completely delete the
environment.

A non-production environment may use generic authentication
credentials. The passwords used in non-production environment may not
conform to the standard password policy of the organization. In such a
case, unauthorized access becomes very easy. 

An organization may create a non-production environment by copying
data from its production equivalent. In such a case, an unauthorized
user can steal the sensitive production data. Examples of such data
are credit card and social security numbers.

To mitigate non-production environment exposure risk, an organization 
should consider the following:

1. Ensure that the credentials used for accessing non-production environments
are strong, and conform to the same standards as the production environment.

2. The data in the non-production environment is not a copy of the data in
the production environment.
