1. At what extent have the project deliveries & objectives been accomplished?  Having in consideration [[OWASP Summer of Code 2008 Applications#OWASP Classic ASP Security Project|'''the assumed ones''']], please exemplify writing down those of them that haven't been realised.
 | colspan="2" style="width:75%; background:#cccccc" align="left"|Looks like all objectives have been meet (documents seems there and some of them were even tested), i was unable to test all of them in deep in order to verify full functionality. I dont have the full platform needed to test it at this point in time.

2. At what extent have the project deliveries & objectives been accomplished?  Having in consideration [[OWASP Summer of Code 2008 Applications#OWASP Classic ASP Security Project|'''the assumed ones''']], please quantify in terms of percentage.
 | colspan="2" style="width:75%; background:#cccccc" align="left"| The tool itself looks like on the right path, altough as the author mentions it's not ready to be deployed.

3. Please do use the right hand side column to provide advice and make work suggestions.
 | colspan="2" style="width:75%; background:#cccccc" align="left"| Documentation (user manual and installation tool) would be a big step to jump into a proper Beta release. I hope Juan can find some help out there to finish this good looking project!

1. Having into consideration the [[:Category:OWASP Project Assessment|OWASP Project Assessment Methodology]] which criteria, if any, haven’t been fulfilled in terms of '''Alpha Quality''' status?
 | colspan="2" style="width:75%; background:#cccccc" align="left"| The repository in google, the rest seems done (although not in deep level of detail)
 |-
 | style="width:25%; background:#7B8ABD" align="center"| 
2. Having into consideration the [[:Category:OWASP Project Assessment|OWASP Project Assessment Methodology]] which criteria, if any, haven’t been fulfilled in terms of '''Beta Quality''' status?
 | colspan="2" style="width:75%; background:#cccccc" align="left"| More work is needed to achieve beta quality. It would look to me, documentation is minimum and could be a bit more elaborated, gaining pretty much of a beta quality (installer are not applicable on this tool).
 |- 
 | style="width:25%; background:#7B8ABD" align="center"| 
3. Having into consideration the [[:Category:OWASP Project Assessment|OWASP Project Assessment Methodology]] which criteria, if any, haven’t been fulfilled in terms of '''Release Quality''' status?
 | colspan="2" style="width:75%; background:#cccccc" align="left"| N/A since Beta has not been reached.

 | style="width:25%; background:#7B8ABD" align="center"|
4. Please do use the right hand side column to provide advice and make work suggestions.
 | colspan="2" style="width:75%; background:#cccccc" align="left"| My suggestion is to try to find people who would like to work on the project, since it's not much what is missing to finalize it.
