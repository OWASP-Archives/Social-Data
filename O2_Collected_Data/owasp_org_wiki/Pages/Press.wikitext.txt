=About OWASP=
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a worldwide free and open community focused on improving the security of application software. There are over 70 OWASP Local Chapters world-wide that are free and open to anyone to attend. OWASP tools and documents can be used to detect and to guard against security-related design and implementation flaws, as well as to add security-related activities into your Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
