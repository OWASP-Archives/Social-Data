'''The perils of auto-configuring IP webcams'''  - Robin Wood aka DigiNinja

I recently purchased an IP based webcam to monitor my daughter at night. Obviously with such precious data coming from it I couldnt just plug it in and let it go so I audited it first, these are my very worrying findings.

Robins commercial background is as a software developer but he's always had an interest in security and from around 2005 Robin has been moving away from general software development and more into security related areas. Robin now works for RandomStorm, a penetration testing company based near Leeds, as Senior Security Engineer running the penetration testing team and developing new projects and tools.
