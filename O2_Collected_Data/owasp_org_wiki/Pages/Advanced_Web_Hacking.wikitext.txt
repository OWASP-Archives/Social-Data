'''Course Description:'''<br>Introduction and adaptation of new technologies like Ajax, Rich Internet Applications and Web Services has changed the dimension of Application Hacking. We are witnessing new ways of hacking web-based applications and it needs better understanding of technologies to secure applications. The only constant in this space is change. In this dynamically changing scenario in the era of Web 2.0 it is important to understand new threats that emerge in order to build constructive strategies to protect corporate application assets. Application layers are evolving and lots of client side attack vectors are on the rise like Ajax based XSS, CSRF, Widget injections, RSS exploits, Mashup manipulations and client side logic exploitations. At the same time various new attack vectors are evolving around SOA by attacking SOAP, XML-RPC and REST. It is time to understand these advanced attack vectors and defense strategies.

The course is designed by the author of "Web Hacking: Attacks and Defense", “Hacking Web Services” and “Web 2.0 Security – Defending Ajax, RIA and SOA” bringing his experience in application security and research as part of curriculum to address new challenges. Application Hacking is hands-on class. The class features real life cases, hands one exercises, new scanning tools and defense mechanisms. Participants would be methodically exposed to various different attack vectors and exploits. In the class instructor will explain new tools like wsScanner, scanweb2.0, AppMap, AppCodeScan etc. for better pen-testing and application audits.

'''Course Overview<br>'''• Application security fundamentals: Application evolution, Web 2.0 framework, Layered threats, Threat models, Attack vectors and Hacker’s perspective.<br>• Application infrastructure overview: Protocols (HTTP/SSL), SOAP, XML-RPC, REST, Tools for analysis, Server layers and Browsers with plugins.<br>• Application Architecture: Overview to .NET and J2EE application frameworks, Web 2.0 application architecture, Widgets framework, Application layers and components, Resources and interactions, other languages.<br>• Advanced Web Technologies: Ajax, Rich Internet Applications (RIA) and Web Services.<br>• Application attack vectors and detail understanding: SQL injection, Cross Site Scripting (XSS), Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF), Path traversal, Session hijacking, LDAP/XPATH/Command injection, Buffer overflow, Input validation bypassing, Database hacks and Blind SQL injections.<br>• Advanced Attacks: Ajax based XSS, CSRF with Web Services, Decompiling Flash and RIA apps, WSDL scanning, XML poisoning, SQL injections through XML, External Entity attacks, Widget exploitation, RSS injections, Cross Domain bypass, and many more.<br>• Application methodologies: Blackbox /Whitebox approaches, tools, techniques and little tricks<br>• Advanced application footprinting and discovery: Leveraging search engines, Cross domain mashup discovery and Web 2.0 application domain enumeration.<br>• Fingerprinting: Web and Application server, Ajax framework, Flash based application and technology fingerprinting.<br>• Advanced browser based attacks: XSS proxy and browser hijacking, Intranet scanning, JavaScript manipulation and DOM injections.<br>• Web Fuzzing: Fuzzing XML, JSON, RPCs etc. for vulnerability detection.<br>• Scanning Web Services: Footprinting, discovery, scanning and attacking XML-RPC, SOAP and REST based applications.<br>• Scanning for vulnerabilities through Source: Function and Method signature mapping, entry point identification, data access layer calls, tracing variables and functions.<br>• Applying validations: Input validations, Output validations, Data access filtering, and Authentication validates.<br>• Web Application Firewall: Advanced content filtering by tools and techniques<br>
