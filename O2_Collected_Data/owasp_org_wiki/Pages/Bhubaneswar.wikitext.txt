<p><b>Welcome Message</b>
</p><p>Finaly Bhubaneswar has a Local Chapter & to do a real kick-off for this Chapter lets meet up next month to decide the future action plans.
</p><p>At the moment the most important thing for all members would be to build a network of people in Bhubaneswar who are interested in the OWASP and at the same time to promote it, so that people who don't know about web application security & OWASP yet, will get awareness about them. 
</p>
