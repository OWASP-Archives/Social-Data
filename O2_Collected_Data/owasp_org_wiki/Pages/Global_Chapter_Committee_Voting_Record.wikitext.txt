| '''Conference split policy under the chapter committee'''<br> Financing of local and regional conferences by the foundation via chapter committee is considered a loan, and it is expected that the loan be paid back fully. For first $1000 of foundation's resources, there is no need to split the profits. If more than $1000 of the foundation's resources is used, the profits are to be split 50/50 with no cap.
