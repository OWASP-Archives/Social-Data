==The Presentation: "Assessing Financial Applications"==

Attackers will go to extraordinary lengths to compromise a financial application; the spoils are just too irresistible. So unsurprisingly these applications have higher requirements for data confidentiality, transaction integrity and service availability than many other web applications.

On a whole, financial applications don't suffer from the usual low-hanging fruit often found in other web applications. This talk will go through some of the common issues discovered by myself over a period of 3 years looking at large-scale financial applications.

It will discuss technical issues associated with common programming languages and APIâ€™s that present a security threat, and how to mitigate the associated risks.
