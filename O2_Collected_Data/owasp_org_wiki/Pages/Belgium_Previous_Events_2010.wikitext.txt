:The Smart Grid brings greater benefits for utilities and customer alike, however these benefits come at a cost from a security perspective.  This presentation will explore how the increased functionality and complexity also increases the Smart Grid's attack surface, or in other words, increases the ways attackers can compromise the Smart Grid's new infrastructures, systems, and business models.  We'll discuss several specific attack avenues against the Smart Grid and recommendations for mitigating or blocking these attacks.

Justin currently leads the Smart Grid Security Architecture group of the CSWG (Cyber Security Work Group) for NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technologies) and is a member of ASAP-SG (Advanced Security Acceleration Project for the Smart Grid).  Previously, Justin served as JetBlue Airway’s IT Security Architect, and has taught courses in hacking techniques, forensics, networking, and intrusion detection for multiple universities and corporations.

:The discovery and execution of entirely new classes of attacks executed from the Web in order to meet your girlfriend. This includes newly discovered attacks including HTML5 client-side XSS (without XSS hitting the server!), PHP session hijacking and weak random numbers (accurately guessing PHP session cookies), browser protocol confusion (turning a browser into an SMTP server), firewall and NAT penetration via Javascript (turning your router against you), remote iPhone Google Maps hijacking (iPhone penetration combined with HTTP man-in-the-middle), extracting extremely accurate geolocation information from a Web browser (not using IP geolocation), and more.

:SQL Injection is a vulnerability that is often missed by web application security scanners, and it's a vulnerability that is often rated as NOT exploitable by security testers when it actually can be exploited. Advanced SQL Injection is a presentation geared toward showing security professionals advanced exploitation techniques for situations when you must prove to the customer the extent of compromise that is possible.
:The key areas are:
:* Re-Enabling stored procedures
:* Old and new ways of obtaining an interactive command-shell
:* Data Exfiltration via DNS
:* IDS Evasion & Web Application Firewall Bypass
:* Privilege Escalation

:''Presentation + discussion:'' What can go wrong when implementing the Belgian eID in an unsecure way to authenticate a user? We will discuss the security issues, the problems with trust, SSL  and some examples of a bad implementation. We will demo how to use WebScarab to intercept and change authentication data on the fly, impersonating somebody else.
:To help developers to implement it correctly, we will give away best practices and a road map to do it properly using the new eID applet with entity authentication.
:This presentation will be given by '''Frank Cornelis''', Developer @ Fedict, who is responsible for the new eID applet and '''Erwin Geirnaert''', co-founder & white-hat hacker @ ZION SECURITY, who has reviewed unsecure implementations of eID authentication

*20h15 - 21h15: '''Analyzing the Accuracy Of Web Application Scanners''' (by Larry Suto)<br>
:''Presentation + discussion:'' Analyzing the Accuracy Of Web Application Scanners
:This talk summarizes my recent [http://ha.ckers.org/blog/20100203/accuracy-and-time-costs-of-web-application-security-scanner-report/ study] related to benchmarking a set of web application scanners against target test sites constructed by the scanner vendors themselves. I will review the methodology and some of the challenges that were faced as the tests were conducted. I have received some interesting feedback from the vendors and the security community. This new information will be integrated into the presentation. The controversial nature of "Point and Shoot" and "Trained" scanning will be addressed and scanning issues related to cloud computing/SaaS will be covered. The presentation will cover some thoughts on open source scanners such as Skipfish and W3AF. Finally I will go into the ideas for another round of testing and the possibility of soliciting target apps from the community.
