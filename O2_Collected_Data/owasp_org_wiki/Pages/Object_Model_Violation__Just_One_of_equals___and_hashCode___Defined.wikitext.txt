==Description==
This class overrides only one of equals() and hashCode().

Java objects are expected to obey a number of invariants related to equality. One of these invariants is that equal objects must have equal hashcodes. In other words, if a.equals(b) == true then a.hashCode() == b.hashCode().

Failure to uphold this invariant is likely to cause trouble if objects of this class are stored in a collection. If the objects of the class in question are used as a key in a Hashtable or if they are inserted into a Map or Set, it is critical that equal objects have equal hashcodes.


==Risk Factors==

* Talk about the [[OWASP Risk Rating Methodology|factors]] that make this vulnerability likely or unlikely to actually happen
* Discuss the technical impact of a successful exploit of this vulnerability
* Consider the likely [business impacts] of a successful attack


==Examples==

The following class overrides equals() but not hashCode().

  public class halfway() {
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
  	...
    }
  }
