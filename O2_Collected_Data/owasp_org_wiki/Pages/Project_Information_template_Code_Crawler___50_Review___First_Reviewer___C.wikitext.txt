The Applicaiton is definitly at least 50% complete. It has come a long way since the original version Alessio and i discussed many months ago. it is a great addition to support the code review guide and of high quality. A comprehensive intalss requirements and useage guide should accompany this tool to encourage use.

XML Driven Code Scan with OWASP Code Review Guide Database (updated) - Nice and extensible. Additional signatures can be added with ease. This is very important.

1.Easy to use UI for a faster and more friendly code review: The tool is now much eaier to navigate and view issues. ease of use is key to the adoption of such a tool to the wider community.

2.HTML Type Reports functionality will generate reports based on easy to build personalised templates.: Works, should me a selection of templates to choose from. Some people would like to simply use the tool and not be worried about customisation.

XSLT Ready to use XSLT templates for a "ready to go" installation.: Works but it is important that clear documentation be delivered along with the tool so that users can start usong the tool in a quick manner.

Good documentation is required.
Looking foreward to Visual Studio .NET Solutions scans. A diff solution would be good. Metrics are also useful in an enterprise environment. (See metrics section in new code review guide).
