== The Digital Security Forum | 7-8 November 2008, Lisbon==

'''If you will be in the OWASP EU Summit 2008, take the chance to know Lisbon and attend this [http://www.segurancadigital.org/en/ conference]'''

Information Security (and its technological and digital supports) has been one of the most increasing concerns worldwide. Each day new techniques emerge, new attacks, and also new defenses, making it almost impossible for professionals to have time to update their knowledge, and companies end up not having an agenda allowing the participation of these professionals in training and events, but we must understand that this is an investment of great value.

It has been increasingly more necessary to adhere to the security levels required by partners and customers, as well as being aligned with international standards. In a world where information is the most valuable asset within organizations, it is essential to know how to deal with the risks of managing this asset, minimizing the impact or even avoiding attacks on systems where the information is stored and transported.

Considering all these factors, the organizers of the Digital Security Forum offer to all professionals in the field of information security, researchers, academics, security officers and auditors a forum to discuss and exchange information, not only about the present but also on the future of Information Security. Find out how the top technology companies manage the problems inherent to Information Security management, by participating in the Digital Security Forum, with leading professionals in the field, national and international.
