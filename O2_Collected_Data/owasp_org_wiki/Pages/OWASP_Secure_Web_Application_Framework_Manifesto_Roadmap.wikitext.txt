Short-Term Goals:

 * Move to version 1.0 by Jan 2011 by collecting user feedback and updating the manifesto accordingly
 * Reach out to at least 3 web application frameworks and let the know about the road map and seek their feedback on the feasibility of implementing it by Jan 2011
 * Start development on integrating this into Django or a spin-off by Jan 2011
 * Build a visual "feature comparison chart" by June 2011 so that frameworks can advertise their self-assessment against the manifesto. This would be similar to the kind of comparison chart that product vendors use to contrast different versions of their products.

Long-Term Goals:

 * Create a new release of the manifesto every three years (analogous to the OWASP Top 10)
