Back to [[OWASP EU Summit 2008]]

==Sponsor the Summit==
The EU Summit 2008 OWASP Conference is the '''premier gathering of Information Security leaders'''. Executives from Fortune 500 firms along with technical thought leaders such as security architects and lead developers will be traveling to hear the '''cutting-edge ideas''' presented by Information Security’s top talent. OWASP events attract '''a worldwide audienc'''e interested in “what’s next”. As an OWASP Conference sponsor, your brand will be included as an answer.

OWASP is providing sponsors '''exclusive access to its audience in Faro''' through a limited number of Expo floor slots, providing a focused setting for potential customers. Attendees will be pushed through the Expo floor for breakfast, lunch and coffee breaks. The conference is expected to draw over 350 attendees, including 100 OWASP project leaders financed by OWASP Foundation, who will be looking for ways to spend the rest of their 2008 budget and planning for 2009.

Sponsorship opportunities are filling up rapidly. All proceeds from sponsorship '''support the conference and the mission of the OWASP Foundation''' (501c3 Not-For-Profit). Supporting these events drives the funding for research grants, tools and documents, local chapters, and more.
