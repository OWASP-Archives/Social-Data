'''OWASP for Charities'''

OWASP was founded, and is supported as a non-profit organization, by a group of dedicated volunteers who believe that all applications should be secure and trusted.  As our organization matures we have taken those beliefs broader, and have started setting up ways for our members to donate to the global community.  

Among these initiatives are:

*OWASP has an active Kiva lending team who have donated $9,125.00 to date.  http://www.kiva.org/community/viewTeam?team_id=522
*OWASP in response to the need in Haiti has set up a secure and trusted way for those within the OWASP community to donate funds to help the people of Haiti. This allows our OWASP community to help another with a single global voice.  100% of the collected donations will be transferred directly to victims for disaster relief such as food and medical requirements.  Please visit www.owasp.org and click the link for G33k-4-HAITI.  

As the world becomes more dependent on technology and particularly web applications, there are many who need protection who simply have no options to protect themselves.  These include small companies, individuals, charities, and NGO's. The aim of OWASP for charities is to place skilled IT volunteers where their expertise and experience can be put to good use helping those helping others. 
  


'''What OWASP for Charities requires:'''

*Volunteers in the IT community willing to give up an hour or more of their time helping Aid organisations/NGO's and other smaller companies and charities, tackle their technology issues. This could be anything from the hardening of web servers and donation pages to ensuring the servers themselves can withstand the loads often seen during times of crisis. 
*Volunteers able to help charities on the ground with basic IT problem solving and development. 
*Suggestions of charities/organisations in need. 


 
'''If you are able to volunteer:'''
*Send me an email outlining your expertise and how you can help. In addition, tell me where you are located


'''If you are a charity or organisation in need:'''
*Let us know how you need help and what can be done. We have a wide reach of IT professionals all over the globe who are in a position to help with most IT related problems. 


What makes OWASP different to others offering the same service?. We are a global organisation, with a ever-widening reach globally. With over 10 000 active members worldwide, it is possible to help in areas that others might not be able to. To that end, we all share the same end goal of helping where possible and as much as we can. Johnny's Hackers for Charity [http://www.hackersforcharity.org] project has done some amazing work in East Africa and one we fully support. 

We hope you will support OWASPs efforts to make a difference  in any of the above ways. We are also open to suggestions in regards to where you feel the OWASP Community can be of service.
