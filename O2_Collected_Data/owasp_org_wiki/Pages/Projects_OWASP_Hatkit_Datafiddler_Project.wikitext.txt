| project_description =
*The Datafiddler is a tool for performing advanced analysis of http traffic. It currently consists of two main views, one table-based and one tree-based. These views allow the user to study different aspects of the http traffic, with very high degree of configurability. The tool is also meant to be a framework which can utilize existing tools to analyze traffic post mortem (or real-time).
*Built in Python/Qt + MongoDB.
