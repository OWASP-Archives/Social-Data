==Description==

Java packages are not inherently closed; therefore, relying on them for code security is not a good practice.

'''Consequences'''

* Confidentiality: Any data in a Java package can be accessed outside of the Java framework if the package is distributed.
* Integrity: The data in a Java class can be modified by anyone outside of the Java framework if the packages is distributed.

'''Exposure period'''

Design through Implementation: This flaw is a style issue, so it is important to not allow direct access to variables and to protect objects.

'''Platform'''

* Languages: Java
* Operating platforms: Any

'''Required resources'''

Any

'''Severity'''

Medium

'''Likelihood of exploit'''

Medium

The purpose of package scope is to prevent accidental access. However, this protection provides an ease-of-software-development feature but not a security feature, unless it is sealed.

==Risk Factors==

TBD


==Examples==

In Java:

package math;

public class Lebesgue implements Integration{

 public final Static String youAreHidingThisFunction(functionToIntegrate){
     return ...;
}

==Related [[Attacks]]==

* [[Attack 1]]
* [[Attack 2]]


==Related [[Vulnerabilities]]==

* [[Vulnerability 1]]
* [[Vulnerabiltiy 2]]

==Related [[Controls]]==

* Design through Implementation: Data should be private static and final whenever possible. This will assure that your code is protected by instantiating early, preventing access and tampering. 


==Related [[Technical Impacts]]==

* [[Technical Impact 1]]
* [[Technical Impact 2]]


==References==
