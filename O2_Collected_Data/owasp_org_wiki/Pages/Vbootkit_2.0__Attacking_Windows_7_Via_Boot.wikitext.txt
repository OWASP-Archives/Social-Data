This talk will introduce a new tool which allows attacks against Windows 7 via boot sectors. In this talk, Vbootkit 2.0 will be demonstrated in action to show how to bypass and circumvent security policies/architecture using customized boot sectors for Windows 7 (x64). The talk will cover:

*Windows 7 Boot architecture
*Vbootkit 2.0 architecture and inner workings
*Insight into the Windows 7 minkernel

Demonstration will also include:

*The use of Vbootkit in gaining access to a system without leaving traces
*Leveraging normal programs to escalate system privileges
*Remote control windows 7 using ping packets
*Remote key logger
*Running unsigned code in kernel

All this is done, without having any footprint on the HDD (everything is in memory). It also remains invisible to all existing anti-virus solutions.
