1. At what extent have the project deliveries & objectives been accomplished?  Having in consideration [[OWASP Summer of Code 2008 Applications - Need Futher Clarifications#OpenPGP Extensions for HTTP - Enigform and mod_openpgp|'''the assumed ones''']], please exemplify writing down those of them that haven't been realised.
 | colspan="2" style="width:75%; background:#cccccc" align="left"|I'm working on more replay-attacks countermeasures, and we are deciding on the "Demo Site" issue. I still have to do research on WebGoat, but I also thought about creating an Enigform Auth plugin for Wordpress, phpBB, etc. I'd like to point out that the maotest.buanzo.org website is a TESTING site, and not an actual Demo site. Still to  implement: * Automatic Sessions Termination on Firefox Exit/Crash, * Better error-handling (Client side), * More documentation (current one suffices to implement a mod_openpgp enabled Apache server, but lacks better client-side FAQs and HOWTOs).

2. At what extent have the project deliveries & objectives been accomplished?  Having in consideration [[OWASP Summer of Code 2008 Applications - Need Futher Clarifications#OpenPGP Extensions for HTTP - Enigform and mod_openpgp|'''the assumed ones''']], please quantify in terms of percentage.
 | colspan="2" style="width:75%; background:#cccccc" align="left"|I agree with Mark Roxberry's 60% completeness. The other 40% will mainly be Documentation, bugfixes and minor improvements, but a big % regarding the Demo site / Auth Plugin idea.

3. What kind of help is required either from the Reviewers or from the OWASP Community?
 | colspan="2" style="width:75%; background:#cccccc" align="left"|Mark has been a GREAT help. He was not only a reviewer but a devoted beta tester. I'm glad to be working with him.
