==Conference Location==

This year, the OWASP Europe Conference was held in Belgium at the Catholic University of Leuven (aka Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, or K.U. Leuven) in Leuven, which is 25 km from Brussels. More information about the location is presented below.

==Agenda and Presentations==

See the [[AppSec_Europe_2006/Agenda | agenda page]] for the conference agenda and copies of all the presentations.

==Training Day==

OWASP arranged a one-day training course on Web Application Security which was offered on May 29th, the day prior to the conference. More information about this one day tutorial is available here: [[AppSec_Europe_2006/Training | The Foundations of Web Application Security]]. This course provides a great introduction for conference attendees into the fundamental security issues that are highly prevalent in today's Web Applications. The prevalence of such vulnerabilities is why OWASP was formed to raise awareness of and help organizations and individuals eliminate such vulnerabilities from their application code.

OWASP also provided a second one-day training course on Web Services Security. Information on this course is available here: [[AppSec_Europe_2006/Training | Web Services Security]].

==Evening Social Event - May 30th==

At every conference we have an evening social event the first night. This allows participants to have some unstructured time to mingle with the other attendees. They are always fun and typically attract about half the conference attendees. This year's event was more upscale than in the past, with a three course dinner at the nearby Faculty Club. The Faculty club is a restaurant annex conference centre located in a medieval part of Leuven. You can find pictures and more details here: [http://www.facultyclub.be/E/030_infrastructuur_D.lasso Faculty Club Info].

This event started with a short tour of Leuven as we walk to the club, followed by a short reception and then dinner. Historically, after the dinner is over, a local club is identified and the die hards move to that location. We hope to see you there.

Dinner Agenda:
18h00-19h00: a guided city tour in the historical center of Leuven that starts at the auditorium and ends at the Faculty Club
19h00-19h30: small reception at the Faculty Club
19h30-â€¦.: 3-course dinner with wines
