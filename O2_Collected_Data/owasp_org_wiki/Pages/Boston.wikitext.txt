==== Locations  ====

The Boston OWASP Chapter meets the FIRST WEDNESDAY of every month ('''Unless a speaker can only present another night'''). We usually meet at 6:30 pm in one of these two locations:

''Microsoft Waltham'' -- the Microsoft offices at the Waltham Weston Corporate Center, 201 Jones Rd., Sixth Floor Waltham, MA. 

From Rt. 128 North take exit 26 toward Waltham, East up the hill on Rt. 20. From Rt 128 South take exit 26 but go around the rotary to get to 20 East to Waltham. Follow signs for Rt. 117 (left at the second light). When you get to 117 turn left (West). You will cross back over Rt. 128. Jones Rd. (look for the Waltham Weston Corporate Center sign) is the second left, at a blinking yellow light, on Rt. 117 going west about 0.1 miles from Rt. 128 (I95). The office building is at the bottom of Jones Rd. Best parking is to turn right just before the building and park in the back. Knock on the door to get the security guard to open it. The room is MPR C. 

''Microsoft NERD Cambridge'' -- the Microsoft New England Research and Development Center

==== Upcoming Meetings ====

 '''April 11, 2012'''

Location - Microsoft Waltham (201 Jones Rd., Sixth Floor Waltham, MA) 

Speaker - '''David Eoff, Senior Product Marketing Manager, HP Enterprise Security'''

David is a Senior Product Marketing Manager, within the Enterprise Security Products division of HP focused on Fortify application security. His 18+ years of background in software and hardware enterprise marketing provides a solid foundation for his marketing of the HP security solutions. 
 
Prior to joining Fortify in 2009 and being acquired by HP, David ran Firewall and IPS marketing for the Security division of Nokia Corporation. In addition, he has held multiple positions in product marketing, product management, channel marketing and sales while working for Oracle, EMC, Legato, BMC Software and several start-ups.

Topic - '''Gray, the New Black:  Gray-Box Vulnerability Testing'''

Over the years, two key techniques have emerged as the most effective for finding security vulnerabilities in software:  Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) and Static Application Security Testing (SAST).  While DAST and SAST each possess unique strengths, the “Holy Grail” of security testing is thought to be “hybrid” – a technique that combines and correlates the results from both testing methods, maximizing the advantages of each. Until recently, however, a critical element has been missing from first generation hybrid solutions:  information about the inner workings and behavior of applications undergoing DAST and SAST analysis.
 
This presentation will introduce you to the next generation of hybrid security analysis – what it is, how it works, and the benefits it offers.  It will also address (and dispel) the claims against hybrid, and leave you with a clear understanding of how the new generation of hybrid will enable organizations to resolve their most critical software security issues faster and more cost-effectively than any other available analysis technology.

==== Past Meetings ====

 '''March 8, 2012, with the Boston Security Meetup group'''

Location - [http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Jobspring+Partners,+Boylston+Street,+Boston,+MA&hl=en&sll=42.362243,-71.081628&sspn=0.019549,0.037594&oq=jobspring&t=v&hq=Jobspring+Partners,&hnear=Boylston+St,+Boston,+Massachusetts&z=17 JobSpring, Boylston St.]

Topic - '''Corporate Espionage for Dummies: The Hidden Threat of Embedded Web Servers'''

Speaker - VP for Security Research at ZScaler, along with other speakers at the security meetup.
 
Today, everything from kitchen appliances to television sets come with an IP address. Network connectivity for various hardware devices opens up exciting opportunities. Forgot to lower the thermostat before leaving the house? Simply access it online. Need to record a show? Start the DVR with a mobile app. While embedded web servers are now as common as digital displays in hardware devices, sadly, security is not. What if that same convenience exposed photocopied documents online or allowed outsiders to record your telephone conversations? A frightening thought indeed.
 
Software vendors have been forced to climb the security learning curve. As independent researchers uncovered embarrassing vulnerabilities, vendors had little choice but to plug the holes and revamp development lifecycles to bake security into products. Vendors of embedded web servers have faced minimal scrutiny and as such are at least a decade behind when it comes to security practices. Today, network connected devices are regularly deployed with virtually no security whatsoever.
 
The risk of insecure embedded web servers has been amplified by insecure networking practices. Every home and small business now runs a wireless network, but it was likely set up by someone with virtually no networking expertise. As such, many devices designed only for LAN access are now unintentionally Internet facing and wide open to attack from anyone, regardless of their location.
 
Leveraging the power of cloud based services, Zscaler spent several months scanning large portions of the Internet to understand the scope of this threat. Our findings will make any business owner think twice before purchasing a 'wifi enabled' device. We'll share the results of our findings, reveal specific vulnerabilities in a multitude of appliances and discuss how embedded web servers will represent a target rich environment for years to come.

'''Topic - Bringing Sexy Back: Defensive Measures That Actually Work''' 

Presenter - Paul Asadoorian, Founder &amp; CEO, PaulDotCom Enterprises 

There is a plethora of information available on how to break into systems, steal information, and compromise users. As a penetration tester, I have performed testing on a regular basis that reveals severe security weaknesses in several organizations, and many of my peers have reported on the same. However, once you "own" the network and report on how you accomplished your goals, now what? Sure, we make defensive recommendations, but consistently it has been proven that security can be bypassed. Not enough focus is given to what works defensively. We have a lot of technology at our disposal: firewalls, intrusion detection, log correlation, but it provides little protection from today's threats and is often not implemented effectively. This talk will focus on taking an offensive look at defense. Applying techniques that are simple, yet break the mold of traditional defensive measures. We will explore setting up "traps" for attackers, slowing them down with simple scripts, using honeypots, planting bugs, and most importantly tying these methods to "enterprise security". This talk will also include real-world examples of the techniques in action from a live, heavily attacked site. Topics will include: 

*Using wireless “attacks” on the attackers
*Implementing the Metasploit Decloak engine to find the attackers
*Setting traps to detect web application attacks
*Integrating results into your enterprise log management tool

The goal of this talk is to make defense “sexy”…

 '''Thursday May 26'''

Location - Microsoft Waltham (201 Jones Rd., Sixth Floor Waltham, MA) 

'''Topic - OWASP Top 10 issue #4 – Insecure Direct Object Reference''' 

Presenter - Jim Weiler, Sr. Mgr. Information Security, Starwood Hotels and President of OWASP Boston 

Jim Weiler will discuss threat models, risks and various remediations of issue #4 in the 2010 OWASP Top 10 – Insecure Direct Object References. 

'''Topic - A Web-Application Architecture for Regulatory Compliant Cloud Computing''' 

Presenter - Arshad Noor, StrongAuth 

The emergence of cloud-computing as an alternative deployment strategy for IT systems presents many opportunities, yet challenges traditional notions of data-security. The fact that data-security regulations are developing teeth, leaves information technology professionals perplexed on how to take advantage of cloud-computing while proving compliance to regulations for protecting sensitive information. 

This presentation presents an architecture for building the next generation of web-applications. This architecture allows you to leverage emerging technologies such as cloud-computing, cloud-storage and enterprise key-management (EKM) to derive benefits such as lower costs, faster time-to-market and immense scalability with smaller investments - while proving compliance to PCI-DSS, HIPAA/HITECH and similar data-security regulations. 

'''Presenter Bio''' 

Arshad Noor is the CTO of StrongAuth, Inc, a Silicon Vally-based company that specializes in enterprise key management. He is the designer and lead-developer of StrongKey, the industry's first open-source Symmetric Key Management System, and the KeyAppliance - the industry's first appliance combining encryption, tokenization, key-management and a cryptographic hardware module at an unprecedented value. He has written many papers and spoken at many forums on the subject of encryption and key-management over the years.
