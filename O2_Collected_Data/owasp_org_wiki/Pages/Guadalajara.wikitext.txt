'''Description''': We will review two of the most common Web Application Attacks and Countermeasures for SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by using PAROS and WebGoat.

It was a great experience sharing this time with the students from the Faculty of Engineering of "Universidad de Guadalajara". We had the opportunity to teach the main concepts of SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting. In addition, they had the chance to practice these concepts by using WebGoat and Paros in conjuction with the OWASP Cheat Sheets.

They showed interest at all time and we had a successfull session. All of them were really excited to know new techniques on Application Security. Be aware of our next event that will be held on April. We will keep you posted! 

Here we have some pictures of the event.
