Here is an interresting question which one is more secure?

'''Option A) 10 Asp.Net Application runinng on:'''

* 1 Hardened Windows 2003 Server, IIS 6.0, Partial Trust .Net 2.0 Environment in 10 diferent IIS websites

or

'''Option B) 10 Asp.Net Application running on:'''

* 10 images (XEN/VMWare) of an Hardened Linux ditribution, Apache and Full Trust Mono (1 Asp.Net website per image)

And which one will have more features? (remember that Medium Trust is a very limiting environment)

And which one will perform better? (remember that Partal Trusts in .Net are considerable slower than Full Trust ones)
