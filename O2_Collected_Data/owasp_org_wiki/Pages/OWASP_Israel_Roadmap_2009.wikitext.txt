Getting into 2009, I would like to invigorate OWASP Israel. The economic atmosphere becomes unstable, the hacking economics flourish, which makes open source initiatives such virtually the only option we have to try to win this battle.

My goals for 2009 are:
* A monthly meeting! We are looking for sponsors to host this meetings and presenters to speak in them.
* Translating the OWASP top 10 to Hebrew.
* Getting more Israelis to be involved in international OWASP projects.
* The OWASP Israel conference 2009 around September.

If you have anything else on your mind, please speak up! OWASP is not mine but ours.
