==='''Assessing and Exploiting Web Applications with Samurai-WTF''' | [[Assessing and Exploiting Web Applications with Samurai-WTF|Course Detail]]===
Come take the official Samurai-WTF training course given by one of the founders and lead developers of the project!  You will learn how to use the latest Samurai-WTF open source tools and the be shown the latest techniques to perform web application assessments.  After a quick overview of pen testing methodology, the instructor will lead you through the penetration and exploitation of two different web applications, including client side attacks on the browsers connecting to those sites.  Different sets of open source tools will be used on each web application, allow you to learn first hand the pros and cons of each tool.  After you have gained experience with the Samurai-WTF tools, you will be challenged with a third web application.  This final challenge will give you time to practice your new skills at your own pace and experiment with your favorite new tools.  This experience will help you gain the confidence necessary to perform web application assessments and expose you to the wealth of freely available, open source tools.

==='''Leading an AppSec Initative''' | [[Leading an AppSec Initative|Course Detail]]===
In this two-day management session you’ll get an industry perspective of application security, understand the key vulnerabilities to applications, be able to analyze root cause, and provide practical and proven techniques in building out an application security initiative.  This course gives executives and managers the education and practical guidance they need to ensure that software projects properly address security. The course is designed to provide a firm understanding of the importance of software security, the critical security activities required within the software development lifecycle, and how to efficiently manage security issues during development and maintenance.  This understanding is reinforced through industry awareness, live demonstrations of commonly found application vulnerabilities and workgroup exercises allowing attendees to conduct capability assessments and recommend improvement plans.

==='''Remote Testing for Common Web Application Security Threats''' | [[Remote Testing for Common Web Application Security Threats | Course Detail]]===
The proliferation of web-based applications has increased the enterprise's exposure to a variety of threats.  There are overarching steps that can and should be taken at various steps in the application's lifecycle to prevent or mitigate these threats, such as implementing secure design and coding practices, performing source code audits, and maintaining proper audit trails to detect unauthorized use.

This workshop will enable students to test the security of web-based applications from the perspective of the end user. Security testing is especially useful since it can be done at various phases within the application's lifecycle (e.g. during development), or when source code is not available for review.  The most common threats and their potential impact will be covered (based on the industry standard OWASP "Top Ten").   Hands-on labs and demonstrations will be used to teach the tools and techniques needed to remotely detect and validate the presence of these threats.

== 1 Day Training ==

==='''WebAppSec.php: Developing Secure Web Applications''' | [[WebAppSec.php: Developing Secure Web Applications|Course Detail]]===

Web applications are the new frontier of wide‐spread security breaches. This tutorial will guide through development practices to ensure the security and integrity of web applications, in turn protecting user data and the infrastructure the application runs on. Several attack types and risks will be reviewed (including OWASP’s Top 10), along with how the proper development practices can mitigate their damage. Although examples covered are PHP‐based, much of the content is also applicable to other languages.

==='''The Art of Exploiting SQL Injections''' | [[The Art of Exploiting SQL Injections |Course Detail]]===
This is a full day hands on training course which will typically target penetration testers, security auditors/administrators  and even web developers  to learn advanced exploitation techniques. SQL Injection, although now nearly 15 years old, still exists in over 30% of the web applications. This vulnerability could result in (Authentication Bypass, Extraction of arbitrary sensitive data from the database, Access and compromise of the internal network)

To identify the true impact of this vulnerability it is essential that the vulnerability gets exploited to the full extent. While there is a reasonably good awareness when it comes to identify this problem, there are still a lot of grey areas when it comes to exploitation or even identifying complex vulnerabilities like a 2nd order injections. This training will target 3 databases (MS-SQL, Mysql, Oracle) and discuss a variety of exploitation techniques to exploit each scenario. 

==='''Java Security Overview''' | [[Java Security Overview |Course Detail]]===
The course on one hand introduces the basic security solutions provided by the Java language and the Java Runtime Environment, tackling issues like the Java Security Architecture and the security services of the Java Standard Edition. On the other hand it provides a comprehensive introduction to Java specific security vulnerabilities. Besides the presentations being continuously updated by the latest advances in the software development industry and the most recent achievements of our security research laboratory, attendees can learn how to use Java security features and can examine and correct typical implementation bugs in example source code snippets through a number of hands-on exercises, prepared in a plug-and-play manner by using a preset VMware virtual machine.

==='''Software Security Remediation: How to Fix Application Vulnerabilities''' | [[Software Security Remediation: How to Fix Application Vulnerabilities |Course Detail]]===
This class teaches attendees how to fix security vulnerabilities in existing software. It provides a mix of discussion of project concerns for planning and managing remediation efforts with hands-on coding examples fixing specific vulnerabilities. Attendees will learn how to risk-rank vulnerabilities, estimate remediation tasks, perform coding fixes for vulnerabilities and demonstrate the effectiveness of fixes applied. The focus is on the practical: how to use limited resources to make significant improvements to the security of target applications. Code examples use the OWASP ESAPI Java and Microsoft Web Protection Library. Many classes teach developers how to build secure code from the ground up or teach security analysts how to test applications for security vulnerabilities. This class teaches developers and security analysts how to deal with their existing portfolio of insecure applications. 

==='''Threat Modeling Express''' | [[Threat Modeling Express|Course Detail]]===
The benefits of threat modeling at the design stage are well-documented, yet few organizations are able to perform this analysis technique due to time constraints. Based on our experience in real world situations, Security Compass has developed a one day approach to threat modeling based loosely on a Facilitated Risk Assessment Process (FRAP).  In this class, students learn how to create a “quick and dirty” application threat model using an organization’s most valuable resource: its people. Students learn about the basics of web application security, as well as learn about and perform a real hands-on Express Threat Model. A deliverable template and list of steps will be provided as takeaways for students.
