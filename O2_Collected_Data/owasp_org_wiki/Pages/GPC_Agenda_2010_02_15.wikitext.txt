*The task of setting up a process to manage our planned [[OWASP Project Reviewers Database|Reviewers Drive]] has been pushed forward. Please note the second table is still being populated.
**Thoughts?
 | valign="middle" bgcolor="#EEEEEE" align="left" colspan="0" |
*The outcome was considered fit for purpose.
*Dinis asked for changing the column [http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Project_Reviewers_Database#tab=Project_Reviewers.2FVolunteers 'Projects I would be interested in reviewing'] to allow it receiving text, i.e. to allow the volunteers to specify their broad interests instead of obliging them to point out project names and its links.
*Due to lack of GPC's members attendance, this item will be dealt with again next meeting.

*Spreading [[:Template:OWASP Project Identification Tab|OWASP Project Details Tab]] through [[OWASP Projects Dashboard|ALL OWASP Projects]]. 
**Revised&improved wiki code to link projects and releases -  Has this task been finished? Are there any available instructions/documentation? Dinis & Jason's report on progress made.
 | valign="middle" bgcolor="#EEEEEE" align="left" colspan="0" |
*Jason has pushed the [[Projects/Live CD|new template]] forward. [[:Category:GPC_Templates|See detailed info on the templates set]]. See also Jason's the [http://docs.google.com/View?id=dcn8962c_70cvjsm3gh methodology explanation]. 
*Jason will continue working on it to finished up a couple of questions still open and to document all the process. 
*Everyone agreed the new template means a lot of progress in GPC methodologies and is expected it will help both project leaders and project management. 
*Due to the lack of usage it has been decided to hide the variable 'Project Maintainer' and only show it when needed. 
*Throughout last week, Dinis has also been working on this issue as well.

**The [[:Category:OWASP Top Ten Project|OWASP Top Ten Project]]'s project leader has invited M. Boberski to review the project against the [[Assessment Criteria v2.0|assessment criteria 2.0]]. 
***As a result, M. Boberski has raised a set of questions about the criteria. Please see them [http://docs.google.com/View?id=dcn8962c_63fgm7gbfd here].
***Dinis has built a FAQ wiki page to answer M.and to more broadly make our responses available for future assessment criteria's users. The FAQ wiki page can be accessed [[Assessment Criteria v2.0 FAQ|here]].
***Please find the spare cycles to help to answer the above referred questions.

**Regarding the creation of covers for OWASP Books, Brad proposes we move the process to a volunteer, without buying the source files.
