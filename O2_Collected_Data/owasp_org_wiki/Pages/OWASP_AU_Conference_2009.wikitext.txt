Each course is provided at a low cost of $650 USD to attend per person.

We have two great courses on offer this year, presented by two very well respected traininers, Andrew Vanderstock (OWASP Guide Project) and Pravir Chandra (OWASP CLASP Project). You won't want to miss these courses.


'''Intermediate - Application Secure Architecture/Coding Course'''

At every other conference or training session, you've only learnt how to destroy applications by attacking their weaknesses. The days of shooting fish in a barrel are over! In this course, you'll learn how to :

''Learn about how you can identity and protect your organization's crown jewels''

''Create secure architectures and designs''

''Learn about how to protect yourself using the OWASP Developer Guide, in particular touching on:''

'' Authentication and Identity Management''

'' Access Control''

'' Session Management''

'' Canonicalization, Input Validation and Encoding''

'' Accountability, Logging and Error Handling''

'' Secure the database and services''

'' Secure communications and storage''

The course will be demonstrating how to use OWASP's ESAPI as a fundamental building block to save you slash development time, save money and be secure all at once.

We will be using OWASP's WebGoat for the demos and class exercises, so please come with the latest version of WebGoat ready to go on your laptop if you want to do the hands on component.

(Course will be delivered by Andrew Vanderstock - OWASP Guide 3.0 Author, ESAPI Project etc)


'''Intermediate/Advanced - In-depth Assessment Techniques: Design, Code, and Runtime'''

This course is targeted at those wanting to enhance their software assessment skills. Specifically, the course teaches attendees techniques for design analysis, code review, and penetration testing that uncover a wide variety of vulnerabilities and weaknesses in applications. If you have pre-existing skills and want to learn more this course is perfect. The training course will generally focus on web applications, but most information applies to software of any type. In addition, attendees will learn general methods for protecting against the security issues uncovered by each assessment technique.

The course topics include:

''System decomposition for analysis''

''Lightweight threat/risk modeling'' 

''Identifying interfaces/attack surface''

''Testing business logic and edge cases''

''Assessing for provision of security mechanisms''

''Assessing for key vulnerability classes''

''Risk classification and weighting''

''Root cause analysis and patching''

The course has a primary focus on intermediate/advanced assessment and testing concepts for architects and developers. Automated security assessment tools will be discussed in context, but not demoed.
Delivered by Pravir Chandra.
