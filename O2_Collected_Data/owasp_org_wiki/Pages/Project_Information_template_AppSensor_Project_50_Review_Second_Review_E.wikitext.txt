1. At what extent have the project deliveries & objectives been accomplished?  Having in consideration [[OWASP Summer of Code 2008 Applications - Need Futher Clarifications#P017 - OWASP AppSensor - Detect and Respond to Attacks from Within the Application|'''the assumed ones''']], please exemplify writing down those of them that haven't been realised.
 | colspan="2" style="width:75%; background:#cccccc" align="left"|
The goals for the 50% deliverable include: High level planning & design: Complete
Identify and define attack patterns against applications: This has been integrated as examples for each of the detection points.
Document points of detection within the application for the attack patterns & identify key information to log: 40 Detection points have been documented and categorized by exception type. A description and attack example has been provided for each along with any limitations for the specific detection item.
Each of these objectives have been met. The documentation will be updated per reviewer comments.

* For the detection and response section it is recommend to include an example rules file, how it's included and referenced within the application itself.
* Clarify how and where the intelligence of the response action takes place. Is this action encapsulated in the rules themselves or within another module. Example: determining response for user fat fingering password vs brute force attempt
