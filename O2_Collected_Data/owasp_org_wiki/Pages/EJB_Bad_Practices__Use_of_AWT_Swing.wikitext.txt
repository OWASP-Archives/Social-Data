==Description==

The program violates the Enterprise JavaBeans specification by using AWT/Swing.

The Enterprise JavaBeans specification requires that every bean provider follow a set of programming guidelines designed to ensure that the bean will be portable and behave consistently in any EJB container [1].

In this case, the program violates the following EJB guideline:

  "An enterprise bean must not use the AWT functionality to attempt to output information to a display, or to input information from a keyboard."

A requirement that the specification justifies in the following way:

  "Most servers do not allow direct interaction between an application program and a keyboard/display attached to the server system."
