==Description==
A constant symbolic reference to an object is used, even though the underlying object changes over time.

'''Consequences'''

* Access control: The attacker can gain access to otherwise unauthorized resources.
* Authorization: Race conditions such as this kind may be employed to gain read or write access to resources not normally readable or writable by the user in question.
* Integrity: The resource in question, or other resources (through the corrupted one) may be changed in undesirable ways by a malicious user.
* Accountability: If a file or other resource is written in this method, as opposed to a valid way, logging of the activity may not occur.
* Non-repudiation: In some cases it may be possible to delete files that a malicious user might not otherwise have access to, such as log files.

==Risk Factors==
