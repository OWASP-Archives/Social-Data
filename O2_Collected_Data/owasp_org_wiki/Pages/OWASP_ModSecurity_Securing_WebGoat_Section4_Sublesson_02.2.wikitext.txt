2. Access Control Flaws -> 2.2 Bypass a Path Based Access Control Scheme

=== Lesson overview ===

The WebGoat lesson overview is included with the WebGoat lesson solution.

=== Lesson solution === 

Refer to the zip file with the WebGoat lesson solutions. See Appendix A for more information. 

=== Strategy ===

This WebGoat lesson demonstrates access control bypass: a file from a dropdown list is chosen and sent, but intercepted in the web proxy and substituted with '../../../conf/tomcat-users.xml', which reveals tomcat users and passwords.

The solution to this WebGoat lesson is to prevent directory traversal.

=== Implementation === 

The lesson is mitigated in the ruleset 'rulefile_02_access-control-flaws.conf':
<pre>
  # Lesson 2.2; directory traversal in 'File' parameter of POST request
  SecRule &ARGS:File "!@eq 0" "chain,log,auditlog,deny,msg:'Path Traversal Attack', \
tag:'PATH_TRAVERSAL',redirect:/_error_pages_/lesson02-2.html"
  SecRule ARGS:File "\.\.[/\x5c]" "t:urlDecodeUni"
</pre>
