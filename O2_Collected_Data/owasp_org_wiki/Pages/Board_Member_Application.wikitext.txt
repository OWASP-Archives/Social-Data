== Additional Board Member Consideration ==


The OWASP Foundation is considering expanding the current Board of Directors from 5 members to 6.  The vote for the additional board member will be made at the Mini Summit in Washington, DC.  To be considered for the vote, please provide background information that will assist OWASP members when casting their votes.

Prior to putting your name up for consideration, please understand the following points:

1.  OWASP runs primarily as a meritocracy so heavy contribution to OWASP previously is a requirement. Like being on the OWASP Global committee's for example.

2.  The person has to want to volunteer for the position, because it's a LOT of work, and there is no pay.
