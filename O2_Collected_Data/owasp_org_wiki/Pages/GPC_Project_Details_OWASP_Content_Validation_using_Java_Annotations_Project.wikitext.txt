| project_name = OWASP Content Validation using Java Annotations Project
| project_description = We wish to explore the use of Java annotations for object validation, specifically for content validation. The result will be a framework which should be easy to use with an existing application. The existing approaches are either part of a large framework (e.g. JSR-303), which makes certain assumptions about the application, or restrict the developer in extending and/or customizing the validation framework. We have an initial implementation of a flexible framework which can be deployed with any Java application. We have also submitted a paper on our approach to an international security conference to be held later this year.
