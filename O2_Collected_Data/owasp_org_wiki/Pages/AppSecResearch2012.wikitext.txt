=Welcome= 
We are happy to announce that the OWASP Greek Chapter will be hosting the AppSec Research 2012 in Athens Greece

This conference is practically the OWASP AppSec Europe. Every two years we add “Research” in order to highlight that we invite both industry and academia to participate, share thoughts, knowledge and insight on application security.

OWASP AppSec Research is ''the'' European conference for anyone interested in application security

This year it will be hosted by the Department of [http://www.di.uoa.gr/ Informatics and Telecommunications ] of the University of Athens, Greece and will take place between July 10-13th.

The first OWASP AppSec Research conference was held in [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSec_Research_2010_-_Stockholm,_Sweden Stockholm ] in 2010.

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>OWASP AppSec Research 2012</strong>
<strong>July 10-13th, Athens, Greece</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Aims and Scope</strong>
The objective of OWASP AppSec Research 2012 is to discuss and demonstrate the importance of security risks, threats, and countermeasures in software applications.
The majority of recent high-profile security breaches are mainly attributed to application-level vulnerabilities. Additionally, recent surveys indicate that government applications demonstrate increased vulnerabilities and at the same time elevated risk, as they store and process critical information such as PII, health information, national security data and furthermore operate critical systems.
Traditionally, the focus of the security community has been mainly placed on the network perimeter, ignoring, to a large extent, the increased risk of insecure software. In addition, the proliferation of the use of web-based applications and services from traditional desktop-based browsers to mobile devices, or even the “cloud” has only increased the potential surface of attack and overall complexity. As a result, the challenges in the field of application security have only increased for those that build, test or defend software applications.
OWASP AppSec Research focuses on new threats and vulnerabilities but also novel methodologies for testing and defending applications.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>List of Topics</strong>
We welcome the submission of both presentation proposals and research papers from the full spectrum of application security.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Application security</li>
	<li>Security aspects of new/emerging web technologies/paradigms (mashups, web 2.0, offline support, etc)</li>
	<li>Security in web services, XML, REST, and service oriented architectures</li>
	<li>Security in cloud-based services</li>
	<li>Security of development frameworks (Struts, Spring, ASP.Net MVC etc)</li>
	<li>New security features in platforms or languages</li>
	<li>Next-generation browser security</li>
	<li>Security for the mobile web</li>
	<li>Secure application development (methods, processes etc) and secure coding practices</li>
	<li>Business risks of Application Security</li>
	<li>Starting and Managing Secure Development Lifecycle Programs.</li>
	<li>Privacy Concerns regarding applications and Data Storage</li>
	<li>Threat modeling of applications</li>
	<li>Vulnerability analysis and application security testing (code review, pentest, static analysis etc)</li>
	<li>Countermeasures for application vulnerabilities</li>
	<li>Metrics for application security</li>
	<li>Application security awareness and education</li>
	<li>Securing e-government applications and services</li>
	<li>Government Initiatives &amp; Case Studies</li>
	<li>OWASP Tools and Projects</li>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Important Dates</strong>
<strong>Submission of papers by: April 15th, 2012</strong>
Notification of acceptance: May 18th, 2012
Camera-ready version of papers: June 3rd, 2012
Conference Dates July 12-13, 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Submissions
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>All papers and presentation/demo proposals should be submitted through:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=appseceu2012 http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=appseceu2012]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We accept the following types of submissions:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Presentation/Demo Proposals</strong>
A presentation proposal should consist of a 2 page extended abstract representing the essential matter proposed by the speaker(s). Presentation slides and video takes will be posted on the OWASP wiki after the conference.
A demo proposal should consist of a 1 page abstract summarizing the matter proposed by the speaker(s) and 1 page containing demo screenshot(s). Demos will have ordinary speaker slots but the speakers are expected to run a demo during the talk (live coding counts as a demo), not just a slideshow. Presentation slides and video takes will be posted on the OWASP wiki after the conference.
<strong>Research Papers</strong>
Authors are invited to submit original research papers offering novel contribution, written in English, with a very precise and concise presentation of no more than 12 pages in Springer LNCS style for "Proceedings and Other Multiauthor Volumes". Templates for preparing papers in this style for LaTeX, Word, etc can be downloaded from: http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-7-72376-0.
Full papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review: remove author names and affiliations from the title page, and avoid explicit self-referencing in the text. Submission implies the willingness of at least one of the authors to register and present the paper. All papers will be anonymously reviewed by at least two members of the program committee.
Full papers, presentation slides and video takes will be posted on the OWASP wiki after the conference.</p>
<em>Extended versions of the best research papers on the topic of “Security for E-Government Applications and Services” will be selected for publication on the Special Issue on <strong>“Security and Privacy of E-Government Applications and Services”</strong> of the [http://www.inderscience.com/ijeg International Journal of E-Government].</em>
