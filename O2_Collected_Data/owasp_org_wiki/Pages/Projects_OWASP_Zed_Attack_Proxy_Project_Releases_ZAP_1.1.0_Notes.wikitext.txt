The following changes were made in this release: 

== Significant changes: ==

'''OWASP rebranding'''

Rebranded as OWASP ZAP.

'''Brute Force'''

The ability to brute force files and directories based on code from the OWASP DirBuster? project. 
The new Brute Force tab shows the files and directories found. 

'''Port Scan'''

The ability to port scan sites. 
The new Port Scan tab shows the ports found. 

'''Active Scan tab'''

The new Active Scan tab shows the requests and responses as a result of actively scanning a site. 

'''Spider tab'''

The Spider tab now allows you to continue using ZAP while spidering a site.
You can also pause and resume the spider. 

'''Smartcard support'''

Smart card support has been added c/o the Andiparos project.
The following smartcard devices are known to work on Windows:
* Safeguard
** Aladdin eToken
** Aladdin eToken Pro
* Omnikey
** Omnikey 3121
** CardMan? 6121
* Gemalto
** Reflex 20 V2
** Swiss Stick

The following smartcard devices are reported to work:

'''Attack menu'''

The new Sites tab right click 'Attack' menu allows you to start various scans. 

'''More internationalisation'''

All of the main tabs and menu items have now been internationalised. 

'''Localisation'''

Support for the following languages are built into this version:
* English (The default language)
* Brazilian Portuguese	
* German	
* Polish	
* Spanish	

'''Language selection'''

On start up you will be prompted to choose the language to use.
New languages are automatically detected by the presence of files with names of the form Messages&lt;locale&gt;.properties in the ZAP directory. 

==Minor changes:==

'''Disabled 'default file' plugins'''

The plugins which detect default files are effectively made redundant by the new brute force scanner.
These have therefore been disabled. 

'''Scanner summaries'''

Counts of the number and types of the current scans are now displayed in the footer.
