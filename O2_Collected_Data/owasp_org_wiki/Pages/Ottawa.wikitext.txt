==Your Local Chapter==
Hi Ottawa, welcome to your local OWASP chapter! We are a place to come and meet local developers and information security professionals, share ideas, and learn. We try to hold a meeting at least once every two months in the downtown core. We provide a mix of infosec rockstar talks, hands on training sessions, and special interest discussion groups. We are always looking for new ideas for events so let us know if you have an idea. Email one of us: [mailto:sherif.koussa@owasp.org Sherif], [mailto:sergei.frankoff@owasp.org Sergei], [mailto:mike.sues@owasp.org Mike] or tweet at us [http://twitter.com/#!/owasp_ottawa owasp_ottawa].

Hope to see you at a meeting soon.

'''Microsoft Silverlight Security - A Hacker's Perspective''' 

'''Abstract''' 

It’s not news for anyone how the internet has revolutionized all aspects of our lives. In the past few years there has been unprecedented growth in web applications and their user base. One of the core technologies driving this widespread phenomenon is Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) because it offers the same level of responsiveness &amp; interactivity on web that is available to desktop applications. Microsoft offered its vision of RIA through Silverlight - a framework that allows web applications running in a browser to behave more like desktop applications. 

One of the major enhancements in Silverlight was the incorporation of mini-CLR engine, that on one hand, adds amazing capabilities for web developers but, on the other hand, also broadens the surface area of attack by opening previously nonexistent entry points into web applications. In this presentation Angelo &amp; Kamran will demonstrate how modern hackers can use reverse engineering techniques to take advantage of weak security implementation. They will also show some effective ways of defending against these types of attacks. 

'''Speakers:''' 

Angelo Chan is an experienced versatile software developer who has developed applications, middleware and low-level software for various platforms. With an initial background in Telecom, Angelo has since worked with different technologies and has discovered a passion for .NET. His interests include virtual machines, operating systems, network/application reverse engineering and security. Angelo can be reached at Angelo@WindowsDebugging.com 

Kamran Bilgrami is a seasoned software developer with proven track record of transforming complex business problems into viable technical solution. He has been instrumental in orchestrating highly available, performance centric, fault-tolerant real-time systems in a wide variety of industries including Telecom, Security and Human/Health Services. His areas of expertise include .NET, CLR Internals, Patterns and Security. Kamran can be reached at Kamran@WindowsDebugging.com

'''Location:''' Bell - 160 Elgin St, Ottawa <br> <br> '''Session 1 - Chris Pierre: Beyond Facebook: How Hackers Might Obtain Information Individual for Social Engineering attacks''' <br> As the old saying goes “Know your enemy as you know yourself.” This discussion will examine several sources of publicly available information which an attacker might use to gain background information on a target for the purposes of a social engineering attack. The talk is expected to be interactive, lively and will provoke a discussion on how these systems and processes can be hardened against this type of attack. <br>

Vega allows anyone to scan their web applications for vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting or SQL injection. Written in Java, Vega is cross-platform. It's also extensible, with a built-in Javascript interpreter and API for custom module development. Vega also includes an intercepting proxy for manual inspection of possible vulnerabilities and penetration testing.

His current obsession is building Subgraph, his information security startup in Montréal. <br> 

==== March, Thursday 10th 2011  ====

Speaker: Shan Gu - Accenture - Large enterprises are increasing their adoption of SOA at a rapid rate as interoperability standards and vendor product implementations mature and stabilize. However, moving enterprises into a loosely coupled IT paradigm introduces challenges around security and compliance. How do we address accountability, confidentiality, integrity, and trust in a large loosely couple ecosystem where consumers and providers don’t always maintain a permanent or stateful relationship? There are standards of course that help integrators and Architects design systems to communicate with each other in a secure manner, however these standards, when interpreted in their purest sense are complex and expensive to implement/maintain in large organizations. And systems that are operationally complex in terms of security are ironically the least secure. 

About The Speaker Shan Gu - Manager in the Security Technologies Practice at Accenture Shan is a Security Architect from Accenture who specializes in Identity and Access Management and SOA Security. He has worked with clients in both the Public and Private sectors and in various industries spanning from Health, to Transport, to Financial Services. Shan has spent his recent years focused on helping clients adopt SOA within the enterprise and to do it in a secure and cost effective manner. Shan is a graduate from Carleton University’s Systems and Computer Engineering program, with a B.Eng and a Minor in Business.
