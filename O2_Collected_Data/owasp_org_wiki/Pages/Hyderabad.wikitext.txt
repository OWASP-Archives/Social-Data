'''Agenda:'''

Oracle Padding Attack by B. Satish

Open SAM part II by Sripati MS

=='''About our Speakers''' ==

'''B Satish'''

I have been working as a web application penetration tester since 5 years.  Pentested over 200 web applications during this period. Recently got involved in reverse engineering of binaries, WLAN security and mobile application hacking. Performed a couple of network assessments and source code reviews.  Developed a compiler in the early stage of the career. I have a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science from JNTU, Hyderabad. Passionate about hacking and sharing knowledge

'''Sreepati M S'''

Sripati (http://www.sripati.info/) has little study, moderate & varied experience (dev-2 yrs., security-4+ yrs.), and lots of aspirations (as far as security goes, at least). He started his career in web-application development, then took a detour towards quality compliance for some time (~6 months) and later moved to security compliance. Still learning the ropes, he believes there is so much to learn and so little time! Interested in web-app security (as if ISMS implementation is not enough), so that says something about his guts! He thinks OWASP is a very good platform for web-app people, and that since he joined OWASP, he has learnt a lot from people around him
