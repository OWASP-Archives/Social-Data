'''My OWASP Roadmap'''<br>

'''Focus on quality''': 

In order to gain more widespread adoption of OWASP guidence and vision our deliverables need to be of leading practice qualty. "half baked" tools, whitepapers and guides do not assist and in some cases detract from the OWASP "Brand". A core problem with opensource efforts is quality control which must be addressed. 

'''Membership''': 

The concept of membership is still misunderstood. Signing up to a mailing list is not membership. Membership should be defined as an active supporter of OWASP either by actions or in the financial sense. Quality deliverables also shall drive up membership. Organisations and individuals that acquire solutions to their problems from OWASP may be more inclined to give a little back (Join OWASP). 

'''Initiate Governance (but minimize red tape)''' I believe we need a governance model such that industry shall embrace our goals but also limit the bureaucracy which stifles imagination and creativity. This is a fine line but is nevertheless important in terms of attempting to raise the bar for software security.
