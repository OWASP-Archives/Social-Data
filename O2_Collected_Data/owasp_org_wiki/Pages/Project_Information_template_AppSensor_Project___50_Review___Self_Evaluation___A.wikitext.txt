The goals for the 50% deliverable include:
High level planning & design: Complete

Identify and define attack patterns against applications: This has been integrated as examples for each of the detection points.

Document points of detection within the application for the attack patterns & identify key information to log: 40 Detection points have been documented and categorized by exception type. A description and attack example has been provided for each along with any limitations for the specific detection item.

Each of these objectives have been met. The documentation will be updated per reviewer comments.
