==Description==

The use of self-reported DNS names as authentication is flawed and can easily be spoofed by malicious users.

'''Consequences'''

Authentication: Malicious users can fake authentication information by providing false DNS information.

'''Exposure period'''

* Design: Authentication methods are generally chosen during the design phase of development.

'''Platform'''

* Languages: All
* Operating platforms: All 

'''Required resources'''

Any

'''Severity'''

High

'''Likelihood of exploit'''

High

As DNS names can be easily spoofed or mis-reported, they do not constitute a valid authentication mechanism. Alternate methods should be used if the significant authentication is necessary.

In addition, DNS name resolution as authentication would - even if it was a valid means of authentication - imply a trust relationship with the DNS servers used, as well as all of the servers they refer to. 


==Risk Factors==

* Talk about the [[OWASP Risk Rating Methodology|factors]] that make this vulnerability likely or unlikely to actually happen
* Discuss the technical impact of a successful exploit of this vulnerability
* Consider the likely [business impacts] of a successful attack


==Examples==

In C/C++:

<pre>
sd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);
serv.sin_family = AF_INET;
serv.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY);
servr.sin_port = htons(1008);
bind(sd, (struct sockaddr *) & serv, sizeof(serv));
while (1) {
  memset(msg, 0x0, MAX_MSG);
  clilen = sizeof(cli);
  h=gethostbyname(inet_ntoa(cliAddr.sin_addr));
  if (h->h_name==...)
  n = recvfrom(sd, msg, MAX_MSG, 0,
              (struct sockaddr *) & cli, &clilen);
}
</pre>

In Java:

<pre>
while(true) {
  DatagramPacket rp=new DatagramPacket(rData,rData.length);
         
  outSock.receive(rp);
  String in = new String(p.getData(),0, rp.getLength());
  InetAddress IPAddress = rp.getAddress();
  int port = rp.getPort();
          
  if ((rp.getHostName()==...) && (in==...)){
    out = secret.getBytes();
    DatagramPacket sp =new DatagramPacket(out,out.length,
      IPAddress, port);
    outSock.send(sp);
  }  
}
</pre>
