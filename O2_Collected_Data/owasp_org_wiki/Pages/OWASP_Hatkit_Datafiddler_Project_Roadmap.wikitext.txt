* Implement third-party plugin tools API:
** Implement w3af-plugin to grep traffic (working code exists but is not finished),
** Implement rat-proxy plugin to replay traffic through the passive Rat proxy and gather results (PoC exists),
** Implement httprint-plugin to perform server identification (not started).
* Implement replayer, to replay requests to the original server.
* Implement cacher, to use the gathered data as a cache-repository where the datafiddler acts as a forwarding proxy - but does not forward, only fetches from db.
