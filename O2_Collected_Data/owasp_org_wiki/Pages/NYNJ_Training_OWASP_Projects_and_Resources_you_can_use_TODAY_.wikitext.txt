| Course_Overview_Goal 
=&nbsp;

*Apart from OWASP's Top 10, most [[:Category:OWASP_Project|OWASP Projects]] are not widely used and understood. In most cases this is not due to lack of quality and usefulness of those Document & Tool projects, but due to a lack of understanding of where they fit in an Enterprise's security ecosystem or in the Web Application Development Life-cycle.

*This course aims to change that by providing a selection of mature and enterprise ready projects together with practical examples of how to use them.

*If you are interested in participating in the hands on portion of the course, please bring a laptop.
