'''Welcome to the Forward Exploit Tool Project'''

This project is intended to develop a tool to exploit [[Top_10_2010-A10 | OWASP Top Ten 2010 - A10: Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards]] vulnerability, focused in the unvalidated "forwards".

The main reason for the Forward Exploit Tool is that there is no tool for this fact, as far as I know. On the other hand, I have seen this problem in several applications that I've analysed in last times, besides this problem has been included in the recent OWASP Top Ten 2010.

==Overview==

Unvalidated Forwards can be used to bypass access controls, specific or standard access control. For an automatized tool is difficult to exploit specific facts, but can work well with standard situations. 
So, the focus is standard access control in Java applications, like restricted directory /WEB-INF. Below this directory is all deployed application files: binary/compiled files, configuration, etc. In Java, compiled files (''class'') can be easily de-compiled to obtain source code.<br>
The '''impact''': compromise all files, including source code, information hardcoded (credentials, SQL clauses, IP addresses, etc.). This is a '''high-critical impact'''.
