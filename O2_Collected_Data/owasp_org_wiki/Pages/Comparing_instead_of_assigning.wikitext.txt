==Description==

In many languages, the compare statement is very close in appearance to the assignment statement; they are often confused.

'''Consequences'''

Unspecified.

'''Exposure period'''

* Pre-design through Build: The use of tools to detect this problem is recommended.
* Implementation: Many logic errors can lead to this condition. It can be exacerbated by lack, or misuse, of mitigating technologies. 

'''Platform'''

* Languages: C, C++, Java
* Operating platforms: Any

'''Required resources'''

Any

'''Severity'''

High

'''Likelihood   of exploit'''

Low

This bug is mainly a typo and usually should cause obvious problems with program execution. The assignment will not always take place.

==Risk Factors==

* Talk about the [[OWASP Risk Rating Methodology|factors]] that make this vulnerability likely or unlikely to actually happen
* Discuss the technical impact of a successful exploit of this vulnerability
* Consider the likely [business impacts] of a successful attack


==Examples==
In C/C++/Java:

<pre>
void called(int foo){
        foo==1;
        if (foo==1) printf("foo\n");
}

int main(){
        called(2);
        return 0;
}
</pre>
