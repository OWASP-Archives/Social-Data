__NOTOC__ 

The Department of Computing & Technology, Anglia Ruskin University, with support from volunteer contributors to the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project), is  hosting a free mini conference on Web Application Security in Cambridge on Tuesday 28th February 2012 from 4pm â€“ 8pm,  entitled 

=Building in Security for Application Development=


The Department of Computing & Technology at Anglia Ruskin University in partnership with OWASP are attempting to establish a joint professional networking group and local chapter in the Cambridge/East Anglia region concentrating on aspects of computing and application security as a key part of both organisations drive to promote the importance of including security within application development.  Anyone wishing to help establish a group or become involved, please let us know.

In addition, the establishment of a local Information Security Student Society affiliated to OWASP is another activity we are keen to promote.

== Background ==

Tackling today's security challenges now far exceeds the "we've got a firewall connected to the Internet so we're covered" fallacy.  Increasingly the most critical areas of vulnerability and weakness have become the web application server and client.  Protecting corporate and personal data has never been more crucial with the increasing trend towards mandatory public disclosure of 'lost' data and the ever increasing loss of reputation, regulatory penalties and litigation from victims.<br /><br />Developing secure code is the most effective method of securing an organisations  web applications which results in a more stable and robust application and assists in protecting an organisations brand.  However the ability to develop this code takes additional skill and know-how which traditionally has not commonly formed part of many computer science curricula and most organizations have not focused on instituting a culture that includes application security as a core part of their software development training<br /><br />The Department of Computing &amp; Technology at Anglia Ruskin University is enhancing its curricula and capabilities in information security following its successful BSc(Hons) Information Security and Forensic Computing pathway.  Establishing a joint professional networking group with OWASP concentrating on aspects of computing and application security is a key part of this enhancement.  A key aim the department is working towards is developing a MSc Information Security specialising in Application Security and as part of this activity looking to develop a local Information Security Student Society.<br />
