'''Concept:'''

A 1-day training covering 3 major topics related to integrating security in a software development project: 

Good practices and tools at design stage (security requirements,secure design, threat modeling) 
Good practices and tools at implementation stage (secure coding practices and code review) 
Good practices and tools at verification stage (security validation) 
The entire training will follow a red-line based on a real-life HR web application project in which we will manage security and privacy aspects. Students will cover the entire lifecycle of the application, from analysis to deployment, and integrate good practices and tools based on OWASP material.
