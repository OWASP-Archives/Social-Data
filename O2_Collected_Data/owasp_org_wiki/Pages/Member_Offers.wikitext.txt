== Rules for inclusion in OWASP Member Offers list ==

If you would like to extend an offer that is of benefit to the members of OWASP, please [https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/owasp.org/viewform?hl=en&formkey=dFN1R2NIMTNROXN3dml4ZEcxXzJQYXc6MQ#gid=0 contact us]. Before you do, here are the current rules we follow for maintaining this list:

Offers will only be listed if they meet the following criteria:

# The discount or offer has to be related to the interests of the OWASP community
# The discount or offer has to be in addition to any discounts or offers that are already available to the general public
# Such discounts will only be listed if they provide both a significant benefit to OWASP members AND a significant benefit to the OWASP Foundation.

Significant benefit to the OWASP Foundation includes the offering organization being a Corporate Member of OWASP or some other benefit negotiated between the offerer and the OWASP Foundation.

* Such discounts or offers will NOT be advertised or described anywhere else on the OWASP site, nor will they be individually promoted via any of the OWASP mailing lists.
* The OWASP Foundation may periodically promote the collective set of OWASP Member discounts or offers as needed.
