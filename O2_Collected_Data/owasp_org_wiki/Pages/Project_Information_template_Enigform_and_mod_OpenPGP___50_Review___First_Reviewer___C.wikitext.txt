1. At what extent have the project deliveries & objectives been accomplished?  Having in consideration [[OWASP Summer of Code 2008 Applications - Need Futher Clarifications#OpenPGP Extensions for HTTP - Enigform and mod_openpgp|'''the assumed ones''']], please exemplify writing down those of them that haven't been realised.

Demo of enigform/OpenPGP authentication and secure session management proved successful.  For final we need how-to documentation that Buanzo is working on at his wiki site published on the OWASP Enigform / mod_OpenPGP site.   Also, final review will require a website (Buanzo has one in SVN, but Dinis was interested in using WebGoat) and I'd like a demo of session based attacks against the site with the extensions (maybe we can we use OWASP testing guide examples, see [[Testing for Session Management]])

2. At what extent have the project deliveries & objectives been accomplished?  Having in consideration [[OWASP Summer of Code 2008 Applications - Need Futher Clarifications#OpenPGP Extensions for HTTP - Enigform and mod_openpgp|'''the assumed ones''']], please quantify in terms of percentage.

60% (I worked with Buanzo on testing Enigform and mod_openpgp for secure sessions, extensions appear to work).

Buanzo is a motivated security developer.  Maybe he can provide development guidance after the SoC 2008 for others to learn from.
