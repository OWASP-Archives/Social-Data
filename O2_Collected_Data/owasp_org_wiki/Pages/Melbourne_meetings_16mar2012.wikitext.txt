==== Topic ====

'''Die passwords, die!''' 

It's 2012, and we're still getting passwords so very, very wrong.

Why do users choose ridiculous passwords? Marvel at real world stats!
Why do organisations allow ridiculous passwords? Cringe at the excuses!
Why do business owners prevent better choices? Rage against the status quo!
Why do risk managers resist the completely obvious? A supply of 2x4's will not be available because you cannot be trusted with the truth
Why do developers code the same bad patterns again and again? Rubber hoses will not be available for public safety reasons
Why do security professionals allow this to continue? We suck. We have failed. This failure will keep us paid until we retire.

Or will it?

If this was the real world, this is finger painting where getting paint on your face, the walls, your clothes, and in your hair is deemed a job well done.

This talk will go through the human factors relating to password security, and what can be done about it.
