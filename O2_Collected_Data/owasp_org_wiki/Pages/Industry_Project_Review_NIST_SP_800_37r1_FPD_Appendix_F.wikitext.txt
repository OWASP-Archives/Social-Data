AUTHORIZATION DECISIONS AND SUPPORTING EVIDENCE


This appendix provides information on the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] process to include: (i) the content of the authorization package; (ii) types of authorization decisions; (iii) the content of the authorization decision document; and ([http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:IV iv]) [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Maintenance maintenance] of authorizations through continuous monitoring processes and conditions for reauthorization.


== F.1  AUTHORIZATION PACKAGE ==

The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] package documents the results of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Control_Assessment security control assessment] and provides the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] with essential information needed to make a credible, risk-based decision on whether to authorize operation of an information system or a designated set of common controls. Unless specifically designated otherwise by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Chief_Information_Officer chief information officer] or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official], the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner] or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider] is responsible for the assembly, compilation, and submission of the authorization package. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner] or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider] receives inputs from the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Security_Officer information system security officer], [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Control_Assessor security control assessor], [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Senior_Information_Security_Officer senior information security officer], and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)] during the preparation of the authorization package. The authorization package<ref>The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] determines what additional supporting documentation or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:References references] may be required to be included in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] package. Appropriate [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Measures measures] are employed to protect information contained in [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] packages in accordance with federal and organizational policy.</ref> contains the following documents:

*   [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan Security plan];
*   [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_assessment_report Security assessment report]; and
*   [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Plan_of_Action_and_Milestones Plan of action and milestones].

The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan], prepared by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner] or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider], provides an overview of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Requirements security requirements] and describes the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] in place or planned for meeting those requirements. The plan provides sufficient information to understand the intended implementation of each security control employed within or inherited by the information system.<ref>The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan] is a conceptual body of information which may be accounted for within one or more repositories and include documents (electronic or hard copy) that come from a variety of sources produced throughout the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Development_Life_Cycle system development life cycle]. For example, information system owners inheriting common controls can either list the controls in their respective security plans or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Reference reference] the controls contained in the security plans of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control common control] providers.</ref> The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan] also contains as supporting appendices or as [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:References references] to appropriate sources, other risk and security-related documents such as a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Assessment risk assessment], [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Privacy_Impact_Assessment privacy impact assessment], [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Interconnection system interconnection] agreements, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Contingency_Plan contingency plan], security configurations, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Configuration_Management configuration management] plan, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Incident_Response_Plan incident response plan], and continuous monitoring strategy. In accordance with the near [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Real-Time real-time] [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] objectives of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] process, the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan] is updated whenever events dictate changes to the agreed-upon [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] employed within or inherited by the information system. Updates to the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan] may be triggered by a variety of events, for example: (i) a vulnerability scan of the information system or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Vulnerability_Assessment vulnerability assessment] of the environment of operation; (ii) new threat information; (iii) weaknesses or deficiencies discovered in currently deployed [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] after an information system breach; ([http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:IV iv]) a redefinition of mission priorities or business objectives invalidating the results of the previous [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Categorization security categorization] process; and (v) a change in the information system (e.g., adding new hardware, software, or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Firmware firmware]; establishing new connections) or its environment of operation (e.g., moving to a new [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Facility facility]).

The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:security_assessment_report security assessment report], prepared by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Control_Assessor security control assessor], provides the results of assessing the implementation of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] identified in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan] to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the specified [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Requirements security requirements]. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:security_assessment_report security assessment report] also contains a list of recommended corrective actions for any weaknesses or deficiencies identified in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls].<ref>Organizations may choose to develop an executive summary from the detailed findings that are generated during a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Control_Assessment security control assessment]. An executive summary provides an [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] with an abbreviated version of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:security_assessment_report security assessment report] focusing on the highlights of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment], synopsis of key findings, and recommendations for addressing weaknesses and deficiencies in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls].</ref> Supporting the near [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Real-Time real-time] [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] objectives of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] process, the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:security_assessment_report security assessment report] is updated on an ongoing basis whenever changes are made to the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] employed within or inherited by the information system. Updates to the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:security_assessment_report security assessment report] help to ensure that the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner], [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider], and authorizing officials maintain the appropriate awareness with regard to security control effectiveness. The overall effectiveness of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] directly affects the ultimate security state of the information system and decisions regarding explicit [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Acceptance acceptance] of risk.

The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Plan_of_Action_and_Milestones plan of action and milestones], prepared by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner] or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider], describes the specific [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Measures measures] planned: (i) to correct weaknesses or deficiencies noted in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] during the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment]; and (ii) to address known vulnerabilities in the information system.<ref>Organizations may choose to document the specific [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Measures measures] implemented to correct weaknesses or deficiencies in [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Plan_of_Action_and_Milestones plan of action and milestones], thereby providing an historical record of actions completed.</ref> The content and structure of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Plans_of_Action_and_Milestones plans of action and milestones] are informed by the organizational [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] strategy developed as part of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)] and is consistent with the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Plans_of_Action_and_Milestones plans of action and milestones] process established by the organization and any specific requirements defined in federal policies, directives, memoranda, or regulations. The most effective [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Plans_of_Action_and_Milestones plans of action and milestones] contain a robust set of actual weaknesses or deficiencies identified in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] employed within or inherited by the information system. Assuming that most information systems and the environments in which those systems are deployed, have more vulnerabilities than available resources can realistically address, organizations define a strategy for developing and implementing [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Plans_of_Action_and_Milestones plans of action and milestones] that facilitates a prioritized approach to [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Mitigation risk mitigation] and that is consistent across the organization. This strategy helps to ensure that [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Plans_of_Action_and_Milestones plans of action and milestones] are based on:

*   The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Categorization security categorization] of the information system;
*   The specific weaknesses or deficiencies in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls];
*   The importance of the identified security control weaknesses or deficiencies (i.e., the direct or indirect effect the weaknesses or deficiencies may have on the overall security state of the information system and hence on the risk exposure<ref>In general, risk exposure is the degree to which an organization is threatened by the potential adverse effects on organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation.</ref> of the organization);
*   The organization's proposed [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Mitigation risk mitigation] approach to address the identified weaknesses or deficiencies in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] (e.g., prioritization of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Mitigation risk mitigation] actions, allocation of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Mitigation risk mitigation] resources); and
*   The organization's rationale for accepting certain weaknesses or deficiencies in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls].<ref>Organizations document their rationale for accepting security control weakness or deficiencies.</ref>

Organizational strategies for [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Plans_of_Action_and_Milestones plans of action and milestones] are guided by the security categories of the respective information systems affected by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Mitigation risk mitigation] activities. Organizations may decide, for example, to allocate the vast majority of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Mitigation risk mitigation] resources initially to the highest-impact information systems because a failure to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies in those systems could potentially have the most significant adverse effects on the organization's missions or business operations. Organizations also prioritize weaknesses or deficiencies using information from organizational assessments of risk and the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] strategy developed as part of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)]. Therefore, a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:High-Impact_System high-impact system] would have a prioritized list of weaknesses or deficiencies for that system, as would moderate-impact and low-impact systems. In general, the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Plan_of_Action_and_Milestones plan of action and milestones] strategy always addresses the highest-priority weaknesses or deficiencies within those prioritized systems.

After completion of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan], [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:security_assessment_report security assessment report], and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Plan_of_Action_and_Milestones plan of action and milestones], the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner] or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider] submits the final [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] package to the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] or designated representative. Figure F-1 illustrates the key sections of the authorization package.


[[Image:80037r1FPD_FigureF-1.png‎|500px|thumb|center|FIGURE F-1: SECURITY AUTHORIZATION PACKAGE]]



== F.2  AUTHORIZATION DECISIONS ==

Authorization decisions are based on the content of the authorization package including inputs from the organization's [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)] and any additional supporting documentation required by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official]. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] package provides comprehensive information on the security state of the information system. [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) Risk executive (function)] inputs, including the previously established overarching risk guidance derived from the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] strategy, provide additional information to the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] that may be relevant and affect the final authorization decision (e.g., organizational [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Tolerance risk tolerance], organization's overall [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Mitigation risk mitigation] strategy, core mission and business requirements, dependencies among information systems, ongoing risk monitoring requirements, and other types of risks not directly associated with the information system or its environment of operation). [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) Risk executive (function)] inputs are documented and become part of the authorization decision. Organizations determine how the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] strategy and risk-related guidance from the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)] influences/impacts the authorization decisions of authorizing officials. [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization Security authorization] decisions are conveyed to information system owners and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control common control] providers and are made available to selected officials within the organization (e.g., information system owners inheriting common controls, authorizing officials for interconnected systems, chief information officers, senior information security officers, information owners/stewards). There are two types of authorization decisions that can be rendered by authorizing officials:

*   [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorization_to_Operate Authorization to operate];<ref>An [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Interim_Authorization_to_Test interim authorization to test] is a special type of authorization decision allowing an information system to operate in an [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Operational_Environment operational environment] for the express purpose of testing the system with actual operational (i.e., live) data for a specified time period. An [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Interim_Authorization_to_Test interim authorization to test] is granted by an [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] only when the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Operational_Environment operational environment] or live data is required to complete specific test objectives.</ref> and
*   [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Denial_of_Authorization_to_Operate Denial of authorization to operate].


=== [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorization_to_Operate Authorization to Operate] ===

If the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official], after reviewing the authorization package and any additional inputs provided by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)], deems that the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation is acceptable, an [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorization_to_Operate authorization to operate] is issued for the information system or for the common controls inherited by organizational information systems. The information system is authorized to operate for a specified time period in accordance with the terms and conditions established by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official].<ref>Some organizations may choose to use the term [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Interim_Authorization_to_Operate interim authorization to operate] to focus attention on the increased risk being accepted by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] in situations where there are significant weaknesses or deficiencies in the information system, but an overarching mission necessity requires placing the system into operation or continuing its operation.</ref>  For [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control common control] providers external to an information system, the authorization decision means that the common controls under their control are approved for [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Inheritance inheritance] by organizational information systems. An [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:authorization_termination_date authorization termination date] is also established by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] as a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Condition condition] of authorization. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:authorization_termination_date authorization termination date] can be adjusted by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] to reflect an increased [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Level_of_Concern level of concern] regarding the security state of the information system including the security control employed within or inherited by the system. Authorization [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Termination termination] dates do not exceed the maximum allowable time periods for authorization established by federal or organizational policy.

The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] takes specific actions to reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities identified during the execution of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management Risk Management] Framework unless the vulnerabilities have been explicitly accepted as part of the authorization decision. In addition, the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner] or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider] establishes a disciplined, structured, and repeatable process to monitor the ongoing effectiveness of the deployed [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] and the progress of any actions taken to correct or eliminate weaknesses or deficiencies. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Plan_of_Action_and_Milestones plan of action and milestones] submitted by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner] is used by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] to monitor the progress in correcting deficiencies and weaknesses noted during the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Control_Assessment security control assessment].


=== [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Denial_of_Authorization_to_Operate Denial of Authorization to Operate] ===

If the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official], after reviewing the authorization package and any additional inputs provided by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)], deems that the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation is unacceptable and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Immediate immediate] steps cannot be taken to reduce the risk to an acceptable level, a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Denial_of_Authorization_to_Operate denial of authorization to operate] is issued for the information system or for the common controls inherited by organizational information systems. The information system is not authorized to operate and is not placed into operation. If the system is currently in operation, all [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Activity activity] is halted. For [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control common control] providers external to an information system, the authorization decision means that the common controls under their control are not approved for [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Inheritance inheritance] by organizational information systems. Failure to receive an [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorization_to_Operate authorization to operate] indicates that there are major weaknesses or deficiencies in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] employed within or inherited by the information system. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] or designated representative works with the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner] or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider] to revise the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Plan_of_Action_and_Milestones plan of action and milestones] to ensure that appropriate [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Measures measures] are taken to correct the identified weaknesses or deficiencies.

A special case of a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Denial_of_Authorization_to_Operate denial of authorization to operate] is an authorization rescission. Authorizing officials can rescind a previous authorization decision at any time in situations where there is a specific [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Violation violation] of: (i) federal/organizational security policies, directives, regulations, standards, guidance, or practices; or (ii) the terms and conditions of the original authorization. For example, failure to maintain an effective continuous monitoring program may be grounds for rescinding an authorization decision. Authorizing officials consult with the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)] and the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Senior_Information_Security_Officer senior information security officer] before rescinding security authorizations.


== F.3  AUTHORIZATION DECISION DOCUMENT ==

The authorization decision document transmits the final [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] decision from the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] to the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner] or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider] and other key organizational officials, as appropriate. The authorization decision document contains the following information:

*   Authorization decision;
*   Terms and conditions for the authorization;
*   [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorization_termination_date Authorization termination date] (if applicable); and
*   [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) Risk executive (function)] input (if provided).

The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] decision indicates whether the information system is: (i) authorized to operate; or (ii) not authorized to operate. For common controls, the authorization decision means that the controls are approved for [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Inheritance inheritance] by organizational information systems. The terms and conditions for the authorization provide a description of any limitations or restrictions placed on the operation of the information system or the implementation of common controls that must be followed by the system owner or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider]. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:authorization_termination_date authorization termination date], established by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official], indicates when the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] expires and reauthorization is required. An [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official_Designated_Representative authorizing official designated representative] prepares the authorization decision document for the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] with authorization recommendations, as appropriate. The authorization decision document is attached to the original authorization package and transmitted to the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner] or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider].<ref>Authorization decision documents may be digitally signed to ensure [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authenticity authenticity].</ref>

Upon receipt of the authorization decision document and authorization package, the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner] or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider] accepts the terms and conditions of the authorization. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner] or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider] retains the original authorization decision document and authorization package.<ref>Organizations may choose to employ automated tools to support the development, distribution, and archiving of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] documentation to include [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Artifacts artifacts] associated with the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] process.</ref> The organization ensures that authorization documents for information systems and for common controls are available to appropriate organizational officials (e.g., information system owners inheriting common controls, the risk executive [function], chief information officers, senior information security officers, information system security officers). The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Contents contents] of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] documentation, especially information regarding information system vulnerabilities, are: (i) marked and appropriately [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Protected protected] in accordance with federal/organizational policy; and (ii) retained in accordance with the organization's record retention policy. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] verifies on an ongoing basis, that the terms and conditions established as part of the authorization are being followed by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner] or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider].


== F.4  ONGOING AUTHORIZATION ==

A robust and comprehensive continuous monitoring<ref>Continuous monitoring is described in Appendix G.</ref> strategy integrated into the organization's [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Development_Life_Cycle system development life cycle] process, promotes [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] on an ongoing basis and can significantly reduce the resources required for reauthorization, if required. Using automation and state-of-the-practice tools, techniques, and procedures, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] can become near [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Real-Time real-time] with ongoing monitoring of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] and changes to the information system and its environment of operation. When monitoring is conducted in accordance with the needs of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official], that monitoring results in the production of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Critical_Information critical information] needed to determine: (i) the current security state of the information system (including the effectiveness of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] employed within and inherited by the system) (ii) the resulting risks to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation; and (iii) whether to authorize continued operation of the system or continued use of common controls inherited by organizational information systems.

Continuous monitoring also helps to amortize the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Resource resource] expenditures for reauthorization activities over the authorization period. The ultimate objective is to achieve a state of ongoing authorization where the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] maintains sufficient knowledge of the current security state of the information system (including the effectiveness of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] employed within and inherited by the system) to determine whether continued operation is acceptable based on ongoing risk determinations, and if not, which step or steps in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management Risk Management] Framework needs to be re-executed in order to adequately mitigate the additional risk. Formal reauthorization actions are avoided in situations where the continuous monitoring process provides authorizing officials the necessary information to manage the potential risk arising from changes to the information system or its environment of operation. Organizations maximize the use of status reports and critical security state information produced during the continuous monitoring process to minimize the level of effort required if a formal reauthorization action is required. Formal reauthorization actions occur at the discretion of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] in accordance with federal or organizational policy. If a formal reauthorization action is required, organizations maximize the use of security and risk-related information produced during the continuous monitoring and ongoing authorization processes currently in effect.

Reauthorization actions, if initiated, can be either time-driven or event-driven. Time-driven reauthorizations occur when the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:authorization_termination_date authorization termination date] is reached. Authorization [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Termination termination] dates are influenced by federal and/or organizational policies and by the requirements of authorizing officials which may establish maximum authorization periods. For example, if the maximum authorization period for an information system is three years, then an organization establishes a continuous monitoring strategy for assessing a subset of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] employed within and inherited by the system during the authorization period. This strategy allows all [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] designated in the respective security plans to be assessed at least one time by the end of the three-year period. This also includes any common controls deployed external to organizational information systems. If the security control assessments are conducted by qualified assessors with the required degree of independence based on federal/organizational policies, appropriate security standards and guidelines, and the needs of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official], the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] results can be cumulatively applied to the reauthorization, thus supporting the concept of ongoing authorization.<ref>The specific conditions under which security-related information can be effectively reused in [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization], ongoing authorization, and reauthorization is described in [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:NIST_Special_Publication_800-53A NIST Special Publication 800-53A].</ref> The reauthorization action can be as simple as updating critical security [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Status_Information status information] in the authorization package (i.e., the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan], [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:security_assessment_report security assessment report], and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Plan_of_Action_and_Milestones plan of action and milestones]). The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] subsequently signs an updated authorization decision document based on the current determination and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Acceptance acceptance] of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.<ref>Decisions to initiate a formal reauthorization action include inputs from the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)] and the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Senior_Information_Security_Officer senior information security officer].</ref>

Unless otherwise handled by continuous monitoring and ongoing authorization, event-driven reauthorizations can occur when there is a significant change to an information system or its environment of operation. A significant change is defined as a change that has the potential to affect the security state of an information system. Significant changes to an information system may include for example: (i) installation of a new or upgraded operating system, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Middleware middleware] component, or application; (ii) modifications to system ports, protocols, or services; (iii) installation of a new or upgraded hardware platform; ([http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:IV iv]) modifications to cryptographic modules or services; or (v) modifications to [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls]. Examples of significant changes to the environment of operation may include for example: (i) moving to a new [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Facility facility]; (ii) adding new core missions or business functions; (iii) acquiring specific and credible threat information that the organization is being targeted by a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Threat_Source threat source]; or ([http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:IV iv]) establishing new/modified laws, directives, policies, or regulations. If a formal reauthorization action is initiated, the organization targets only the specific [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] affected by the changes and reuses previous [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] results wherever possible. Most [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Routine_Changes routine changes] to an information system or its environment of operation can be handled by the organization's continuous monitoring program, thus supporting the concept of ongoing authorization. An effective monitoring program can significantly reduce the overall cost and level of effort of reauthorization actions.

In the event that there is a change in authorizing officials, the new [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] reviews the current authorization decision document, authorization package, and any updated documents created as a result of the ongoing monitoring activities. If the new [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] is willing to accept the currently documented risk, then the official signs a new authorization decision document, thus formally transferring responsibility and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Accountability accountability] for the information system or the common controls inherited by organizational information systems and explicitly accepting the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.

If the new [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] is not willing to accept the previous authorization results (including identified level of risk), a reauthorization action may need to be initiated or the new [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] may instead establish new terms and conditions for continuing the original authorization, but not extend the original [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:authorization_termination_date authorization termination date]. In all situations where there is a decision to reauthorize an information system or the common controls inherited by organizational information systems, the maximum reuse of authorization information is strongly encouraged to minimize the time and expense associated with the reauthorization effort.<ref>The decision to initiate a formal reauthorization action can be based on a variety of factors, including for example, the acceptability of the previous authorization information provided in the authorization package, the length of time since the previous authorization decision, the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Tolerance risk tolerance] of the new [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official], and current organizational requirements and/or priorities.</ref>
