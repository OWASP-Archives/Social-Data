The OWASP Chapters program helps to foster local discussion of application security around the world. Our Local Chapters are free and open to anyone. Sales activities are strictly prohibited, although vendors who can provide useful application security information are welcome. Generally, Local Chapters meet between monthly and quarterly, and have presentations and discussion of key application security topics. Many of the [[:Category:OWASP Presentations|OWASP presentations]] are available for everyone to use.

==Joining a Chapter==
To join a Local Chapter, simply sign up on the appropriate mailing list and introduce yourself. You can find out about the next meeting by checking the [[Main Page|OWASP Portal]] page for your Local Chapter, or by watching the [[OWASP Community]] events on the OWASP [[Main Page]]. All of the mailing lists can be found [http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo here].
