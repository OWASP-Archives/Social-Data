==Overview==

Purpose:	

*	Define a secure default configuration for database resources that are deployed as part of an implementation.

*	Identify a recommended configuration for database resources for databases that are deployed by a third party.

Role:

* Database Designer

Frequency:

* As necessary; generally, once per iteration.



==Identify candidate configuration ==

Choose a candidate database configuration for the database. 

While an out-of-the-box configuration is an acceptable starting point, it is usually more efficient to start with a third-party baseline or to go through a process to identify a candidate baseline. For example, see the NIST database security checklist: http://csrc.nist.gov/pcig/cig.html.

In the case of third-party deployments, the configuration will generally be defined relative to the default configuration.

==Validate configuration ==

For the resources specified that interact with the database, validate that the baseline configuration properly addresses the security requirements for that data.

Also, unnecessary functionality (e.g., stored procedures) can introduce unanticipated risk vectors. Practice the principle of least privilege by removing unnecessary functionality from the configuration. 

In the case of third-party deployments, it is sufficient to specify which functionality is absolutely necessary in the operational security guide, then to recommend that all other features be disabled.

If appropriate, perform testing with a database configuration tool for any candidate platforms to determine non-obvious security risks to resources. Again, make changes to the configuration if necessary, and documenting them in the operational security guide, if appropriate.
