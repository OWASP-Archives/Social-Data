==The Problem==

==Identity Flow Through Application Layers==
All web application security experts will tell you how important logging is [1][2][3][4]. How else can you detect attacks, successful or otherwise? Logs should allow you to replay a user's request lifecycle. In an enterprise web application, this is a lot of work and I'm not happy to tell you not many people are doing it right. 

There's generally two things development teams have to figure out when architecting a logging strategy; what to log and when to log.

===When to Log===
There's sdfsdf
sdfsdfsdf
sdfsdfsdf

===What to Log===
There's a general consensus on what kind of information an application log message should contain:

*date and time
*server IP
*source IP
*URL requested
*module/action/class responsible
*user ID
*description of the event
*severity level

Whether you're investigating your web application's log files as part of a regular monitoring program or incident response, you should be able to follow a user's request lifecycle, all the way from the receival of the request (before the invocation of any HTTP filters).
