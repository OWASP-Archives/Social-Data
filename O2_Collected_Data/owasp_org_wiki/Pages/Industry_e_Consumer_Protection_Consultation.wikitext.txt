''''Promoting Business Compliance''''

''BC1. Why do businesses not use guidance more often, and what can we do to encourage them to?''

Much guidance is not easy to find and often it has to be paid for.  The OFT should promote access to high-quality free standards, guidance and procedures.

This official response has been submitted on behalf of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) by the OWASP Global Industry Committee, following our own consultation process.

OWASP is a worldwide free and open community focused on improving the security of application software. Our mission is to make application security "visible", so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about application security risks.  OWASP has three active chapters in the UK:

* Leeds/North http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Leeds_UK
* London http://www.owasp.org/index.php/London
* Scotland http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Scotland

we could follow and is there a specific location where guidance should be held
such as Directgov, the OFT website, etc)?''

OWASP produces a range of comprehensive, expert-reviewed, standards, guidance documents, code libraries and tools for organisations designing, developing and operating websites and web applications.  Some key ones are:
