=== How to track an OWASP Leader  ===

Ideally we should be able to track OWASP leaders, the question is how? 

What could we give the leaders that would easily identify them (in practical and usable way): 

*a special wristband 
**with a particular color? 
**with a particular logo or message? 
**wth a GPC tag? (or auto-location-tweet) 
*an armband 
*a hat 
*a scarf 
*a t-shirt 
*a bag 
*with a paintball gun?

=== AppSec Soccer Tournament  ===

'''When:''' Friday after the conference<br> '''Where:''' TBC<br> '''Participants:'''<br> 

*Dinis Cruz 
*Kate Hartmann (can also be a referre)

<br> 

=== To do (tasks)  ===

*for each each participant 
**link to MediaWiki user page 
**add twitter accounts 
*Travel arrangements 
**map travel dates 
**when/where they are arriving 
**where are they staying 
*figure out what to do with the leaders when they are there 
*should we create a welcome pack for these leaders? 
*should we see if they need help in their travel arrangements? 
*should we see if its possible to find a local host for the accomodation (it is always better than going into an hotel)? 
*do we need a budget? if so, how much?
