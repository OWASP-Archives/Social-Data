==== Main  ====

This projectâ€™s goal is to create standardized assesment documents (in OVAL XML format) for various application platforms such as .NET, Java, PHP etc. For example, there are several settings like Web.Config file which impacts security of ASP.NET web application. Likewise, PHP.INI has several security related settings. By creating OVAL definitions for these checks, it will enable any OVAL compatible tool (including the free OVAL Interpreter) to perform these checks.
