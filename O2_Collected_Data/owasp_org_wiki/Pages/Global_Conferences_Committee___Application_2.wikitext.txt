 | style="width:20%; background:#cccccc" align="center"| GEC Member
 | style="width:57%; background:#cccccc" align="center"| An outstanding OWASP Member that allocated heart and soul to make the OWASP AppSec Brasil 2009 happens and is already doing the same for the 2010 Edition. Moreover, Lucas is a high evangelist of OWASP resources within the Brazilian IT Community with a strong presence on the Government Sector and Academia.

 | style="width:57%; background:#cccccc" align="center"| Lucas is highly motivated and actually executes on his commitments very well. He did a great job in organizing AppSec Brasil 2009 and would be a great asset for the Global Conferences Committee.

 | style="width:57%; background:#cccccc" align="center"| Lucas has already demonstrated that he's qualified for this position based on the success of AppSec Brasil 2009.  He went from zero to conference is a pretty short window.  Not only did he pull off a successful conference, he did so under fire - he lost several speakers due to the flu, I had a crazy mishap with my flights and barely made the first day of the class I was teaching.  Under all this, he kept his cool and keep the conference on track.  I suspect that the only reason I know about these issues is I was both an instructor and speaker.  For those just attending the conference, they would have only seen a smoothly running gig.

 | style="width:57%; background:#cccccc" align="center"| Lucas is the member who contributes most to the growth of the Brazil chapter, this is due to the excellent organization has done in the first AppSec Brazil. No doubt he is a great name for a Committee.

 | style="width:57%; background:#cccccc" align="center"|Lucas did a great job with the Brazil conference, even though there were problems with travel arrangements he was actively communicating back to me and keeping all presenters updated.  I also met Lucas in Portugal's Summit and his active
participation and leadership would add value to the Global Conference Committee just what we need to stir more OWASP in Brasil!!!!

 | style="width:57%; background:#cccccc" align="center"|The 2009 OWASP Brazil conference was a wonderful success due to Lucas' organization talent, interpersonal skills and passion for security.  I thought he did a wonderful job promoting the ideals espoused by OWASP, providing more exposure to application security awareness in South America.  He also handled the inevitable problems with ease and sprezzatura, resulting in a fantastic and informative gathering.  I recommend Lucas without hesitation.
