| style="width:20%; background:#cccccc" align="center" | Global Education Committee, OWASP
| style="width:57%; background:#cccccc" align="center" | Robert Hansen (RSnake) needs no introduction to those in the web application security world. His contributions to the world of security is commendable and for him to be part of the OWASP Connection Committee is a natural fit, one that I believe will be mutually beneficial. His background will undoubtedly be a value add to achieving the goals and objectives of the OWASP Connections committee. RSnake has my highest recommendation.&nbsp;

| style="width:57%; background:#cccccc" align="center" | Robert has been a valuable asset to the Austin OWASP chapter and would be a great person to be on the OWASP Connection Committee. &nbsp;He has been instrumental in helping our chapter implement new events that help build community and integrate people socially in the group.&nbsp;

 | style="width:57%; background:#cccccc" align="center"|Robert has been working with the Austin OWASP Chapter board members for the past couple of years and has provided immeasurable assistance to the chapter in drumming up membership, getting top-notch presenters, and generally supporting our activities.  He is a stand up person and is amongst the smartest security people I know.  I think he would be an excellent fit for the OWASP Connections Committee role and he has my highest recommendation for this position.

| style="width:20%; background:#cccccc" align="center" |Global Conferences Committee, OWASP
| style="width:57%; background:#cccccc" align="center" |As Manu said it--Robert needs no introduction to those in the web application security world. I believe Robert will be an important asset to OWASP. Robert came to Taipei to support OWASP Asia 2008. We all know how hard it is to get good speakers to fly out to this region. Robert was willing to support on quite a short notice, and provided valuable suggestions in the Asia chapter leader's meeting. I felt Robert knows exactly how he can contribute in an organization such as OWASP, and his experiences and connections will be highly valuable to us. With his knowledge, expertise, and devotion, and his very direct and straight way of communication, he has earned his respect in the security community. I strongly recommend him for this position.

| style="width:57%; background:#cccccc" align="center" |Robert is a great asset to application security community and is well connected to OWASP as well. I met him at OWASP AppSec Asia 2008 in Taiwan where everyone was excited to hear him. With his background, experience, credibility, contacts and regular contribution to the community, I think he brings lot of value to OWASP Connections Committee. He is highly recommended for this position.
