==== Work Model  ====

'''The Dynamic Working Sessions Model''' 

Welcome to the Dynamic Working Sessions world! These will be fluid, informal, exciting and vibrant Working Sessions that will happen throughout the day in different locations and at different times – you can have them as nice discussions over breakfast, round table presentations or heated debates after dinner around a couple of beers! 

<br> '''How will this Model work?''' 

You have here 

*[http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Summit_2011_Schedule_Dynamic#tab=Working_Sessions_List The list of Dynamic sessions] 
*The list of Dynamic time slots and locations for [http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Summit_2011_Schedule_Dynamic#tab=Tuesday.2C_Feb_8 Tuesday], [http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Summit_2011_Schedule_Dynamic#tab=Wednesday.2C_Feb_9 Wednesday] and [http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Summit_2011_Schedule_Dynamic#tab=Thursday.2C_Feb_10 Thursday] 
*[http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Summit_2011_Attendee The list of Attendees]

<br> '''To organize your Dynamic WS you just have to:''' 

*Check the list of available time slots and available locations; 
*Check the list of Attendees and identify the ones you would like to have on your session;

Having into account the availability of both time slots and locations and the schedules of your potential attendees, you can make a decision as to when and where your WS will happen. 

Once you have that decision, you just have to email [mailto:owaspsummit_schedule@owasp.org Schedule Team] and they will put your WS and respective information online. <br> '''Please make sure to include all the following information on the email:''' 

*'''Working Session name''' 
*'''Day & Time slot & Location'''

Please note that this is a very dynamic process – if, on one hand, we need to make it easy for you to organize WS in a very fluid way, we also need some time to make sure that you will have all the equipment needed. 

That is to say that the Dynamic WS will be organized according to this flow: 

{| width="312" height="131" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1" style=""
|-
! bgcolor="#cccccc" scope="col" bordercolor="#cccccc" | WS happening on 
! bgcolor="#cccccc" scope="col" bordercolor="#cccccc" | Info must be sent until
|-
| valign="middle" bgcolor="#cccccc" align="center" bordercolor="#cccccc" | Tuesday afternoon 
| valign="middle" bgcolor="#cccccc" align="center" bordercolor="#cccccc" | Tuesday, 10h
|-
| valign="middle" bgcolor="#cccccc" align="center" bordercolor="#cccccc" | Wednesday

|-

| valign="middle" bgcolor="#cccccc" align="center" bordercolor="#cccccc" | Wednesday, 18h
|}



<!--

<br> '''To attend a dynamic working session:''' 

Check the online Dynamic Shedule of the following day and sign up for the ones you are interested in attending! 

'''Note''' – Dynamic sessions will start Tuesday afternoon. If you would like to attend some of these, please make sure you register during the morning.
