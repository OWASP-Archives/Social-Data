Global Committee Consolidation - Observations and Recommendations submitted 10-Jun via email.

Proposal made to consolidate Global Committees to 3:  Conferences, Chapters, and Projects

Education, Industry, Connections, and Membership committees would be restructured into task forces which emerge from ecosystems as focused working groups with a budget and a charter to meet a predefined goal.


== New business ==

Seba:

* New contract Sarah, (re)negotiation Paulo, status Larry

* Voting Rights for Chapter/Project Leader:

Dave - Yes; Eoin - open vote to all; Jeff - yes, and make them honorary members; Tom - Yes; Matt - yes; Seba - yes

So, board vote to allow chapter/project leaders to vote is affirmative.

Continued vote - do we reinstate the "honorary memberships" as well
