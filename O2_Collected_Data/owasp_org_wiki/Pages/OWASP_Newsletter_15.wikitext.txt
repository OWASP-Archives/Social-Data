== Featured Item: OWASP Week 2008==

Following the success of OWASP Day in 2007, this year we have decided to have the first ever OWASP Week!  This will take place between March 30th and April 4th.  To see what chapters are participating, please go to [[OWASP_Week_April_08]].

== Featured Project: OWASP Guide 3.0 Development Resumes==

Andrew van der Stock, the OWASP Guide Project Lead, is calling for volunteers to re-factor the OWASP Guide to be solely about secure architecture and coding using ESAPI. This will help distinguish the Guide from our other major documents:

* The Guide will become solely about coding securely using ESAPI with J2EE, .NET and PHP
* The Code Review Guide is about reviewing web apps
* The Testing Guide is about testing web apps

Andrew is looking for volunteers to take on individual chapters. There are 16 chapters, and each should take one person about a month to re-factor, followed by a few months for peer review, QA, diagrams, and final acceptance. The goal is to release the final OWASP Guide 3.0 at the OWASP US Conference in late 2008.

If you're interested, please join the owasp-guide mail list:

https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-guide

Once joined, please post to the list with an introduction and a list of which chapters you'd are interested in taking on. If you've previously volunteered, please just say so and priority will be given to your chapter choices.

* The submission period for [[OWASP Summer of Code 2008|OWASP Summer of Code 2008]] applications finished off on 25th March. 
* The open-source software community has answered positively [[OWASP Summer of Code 2008 Applications|uploading 35 applications]]. 
* We thank everybody who has applied. 
* We announce a two-week-delay in the assessment of OWASP Summer of Code’s 2008 applications. We are now planning to deliver our assessment on the 16th April. Hence, the whole SoC’s 2008 schedule will be postponed two weeks.
** Having carefully analysed the set of 35 applications, we have decided to request that 18 applicants adjust their proposals. [[OWASP Summer of Code 2008 Applications - Need Futher Clarifications|These 18 applications can be found here]].
*** For each one, we have posted a couple of recommendations. Consequently, we ask that each applicant answer just below our recommendations, whether or not they are accepted. If so, please leave a clear note of it and modify accordingly your applications in the same wiki page.
*** We also recommend that applicants state positions by the 9th of April.
** The remaining set of applications can be found on either the [http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pAX6n7m2zaTXckoJGOB0_LA Majority Vote Page] or [http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pAX6n7m2zaTXfkbcvHAVnUA&gid=0 Selection Criteria Page]. Although the new official date to announce the SoC’s 2008 is now the 16th of April, we will post our assessment as soon as it has been reached. At this moment, the applicants can of course start working. However, we will return to all applicants later, once the assessment process has been totally completed, with further details.
** We understand the inconvenience that this might cause and apologise for that. Although, as we are acting to improve the SoC’s final deliveries, we also ask for understanding and we thank in advance.
