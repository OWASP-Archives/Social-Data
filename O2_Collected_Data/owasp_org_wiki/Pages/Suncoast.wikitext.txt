== Next Meeting ==
'''Topic:''' Social Engineering Trends and Tactics  (In conjunction with Suncoast Security Society) 

'''Date/Time:''' February 15, 2012 @ 6:00pm

'''Location:''' The Community Foundation of Sarasota County (2635 Fruitville Road Sarasota, FL 34237)

'''Presenter:''' Brian Jack (Director of Security Research at KnowBe4, President iAssault Technologies)

'''Presentation Details:''' Trends in cyber warfare show that attacks involving social engineering are on the rise. Large organizations and governments are not the only ones being targetted; the bad guys are equal opportunists and are going after small and medium sized enterprises. Recent research involving social engineering attacks shows most organizations are vulnerable to very simple scams. How are these bad
guys getting in, and why are they so successful? What is the industry currently doing to prevent these attacks? What are some simple things you can do to better protect your organization?  This presentation aims to answer those questions and give a more detailed look at social engineering tactics that are currently affecting today's enterprises.

Pizza and drinks will be provided, come out, tell your friends, and support the group.

== Past Meetings ==
'''Topic:''' Injection Attacks: #1 and still going strong (In conjunction with Suncoast Security Society)

'''Date/Time:''' June 14, 2011 @ 6:00pm

'''Location:''' The Community Foundation of Sarasota County (2635 Fruitville Road Sarasota, FL 34237)

'''Presenter:''' Steve Carter

'''Presentation Details:''' Injection attacks are #1 on the OWASP Top Ten list of application vulnerabilities.  This session will start with an in-depth explanation of what injections attacks are why they have managed to capture #1 spot in the Top Ten.  Using various OWASP and open source tools we will then demonstrate how one discovers, executes and defends against injection attacks.



'''Topic:''' How To Hack Companies and Make Millions - In conjunction with Suncoast Security Society

'''Date/Time:''' February 16, 2011 @ 6:00pm

'''Location:''' The Community Foundation of Sarasota County (2635 Fruitville Road Sarasota, FL 34237)

'''Presenter:''' Chris Hadnagey

'''Presentation Details:''' Offensive Security wants to take you on a non-stop thrill ride through an actual hack.  From Information Gathering, Social Engineering and Client Side Exploitation we will show you the complete and total domination of the target.  This session will showcase the skills that are taught in Offensive Security’s world-renowned courses as well as our Penetration Testing services.  Our goal is raise awareness of the real world threats that exist in corporate business today.


'''Topic:''' Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) - in conjunction with the Sarasota Java Users Group (Sunjug)

'''Date/Time:''' February 24, 2010

'''Location:''' The Community Foundation of Sarasota County (2635 Fruitville Road Sarasota, FL 34237)

'''Presenter:''' Steve Goldsmith

'''Presentation Details:''' SAML is an XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between security domains, that is, between an identity provider (a producer of assertions) and a service provider (a consumer of assertions). SAML is a product of the OASIS Security Services Technical Committee.

Since there are many facets to SAML Steve will give a brief overview of SAML and then jump right into a real world scenario using a service provider. The service provider will accept an encrypted and signed assertion from an external entity which will be decrypted and have its attributes revealed. This can be used to integrate an external entities' SSO system into legacy web applications without the need to implement expensive and complex federated security solutions like SIteMinder, etc.

Steve has built the code using OpenSAML for encryption and signing assertions as well to allow end to end testing using Apache Http Client. He will cover topics all the way down to creating RSA key pairs in a Java key store using keytool, so in essence this is a complete solution. The talk will not be covering SSO solutions like JOSSO as this is perhaps better covered at a later date.

'''Date/Time:''' October 29, 2009 - 6:00pm

'''Location:''' Gevity HR in Lakewood Ranch (9000 Town Center Pkwy, Lakewood Ranch, FL 34202)

'''Presenter:''' James Tarala  (See bio at http://www.sans.org/security-training/instructors.php#Tarala)

'''Presentation Details:''' "Software Assessment Tools & Methodologies"

''Recent reports, such as the SANS Top Security Risks Report (http://www.sans.org/top-cyber-security-risks/) have indicated that operating system security is no longer one of the biggest challenges to organizations' information security today. Instead one of the primary vectors used by those who threaten information resources are individual applications that reside on an organization's systems. Software applications have become the greater vulnerability to an organization today. In this presentation James Tarala of Enclave Security and a frequent instructor at the SANS Institute will present tools and methodologies for assessing these applications in an effort to better secure an organization's systems''

'''Date/Time:''' CANCELLED!

'''Location:''' Gevity HR in Lakewood Ranch (9000 Town Center Pkwy, Lakewood Ranch, FL 34202)

'''Presenter:''' Wes Brown

'''Presentation Details:''' "So You Want To Analyze Malware?"

''Malware is a broad category of malicious software that covers trojans, viruses, worms, rootkits, and other software that steals information or subverts computers into unintended purposes. There are many reasons why one would want to analyze malware, and they can range from professional interest in defending networks from them, to personal fascination in the techniques involved in crafting them.''

''Whatever one’s reason for analyzing malware, Wes will share many of the techniques that he’s utilized in the course of his career working on client incident response engagements as well as a full time analyst on a heuristic detection product.''

''Many might think that the techniques are dominated by methods such as reverse engineering and binary analysis, and indeed it is a major part of any analyst’s toolkit. However, statistical analysis, and static forensics can often play just as key a role, combined with scripting, systems management, and data warehousing.''

''Wes will describe and show examples of such techniques, as well as supporting tools. The emphasis will be on doing this with low cost or free tools, so that an audience member can get up and running quickly with malware analysis even on a shoestring budget.''
