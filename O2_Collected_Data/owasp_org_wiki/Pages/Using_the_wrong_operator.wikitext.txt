==Description==
This is a common error given when an operator is used which does not make sense in context.

'''Consequences'''

Unspecified.

'''Exposure period'''

* Pre-design through Build: The use of tools to detect this problem is recommended.
* Implementation: Many logic errors can lead to this condition. It can be exacerbated by lack, of or misuse, of mitigating technologies. 

'''Platform'''

* Languages: Any
* Operating platforms: Any

'''Required resources'''

Any

'''Severity'''

Medium

'''Likelihood of exploit'''

Low

These types of bugs generally are the result of a typo. Although most of them can easily be found when testing of the program, it is important that one correct these problems, since they almost certainly will break the code.

==Risk Factors==

TBD


==Examples==

In C:

<pre>
char foo;
foo=a+c;
</pre>

* [[Attack 2]]


==Related [[Vulnerabilities]]==

* [[Vulnerability 1]]
* [[Vulnerabiltiy 2]]



==Related [[Controls]]==

* Pre-design through Build: Most static analysis programs should be able to catch these errors.
* Implementation: Save an index variable. This is the recommended solution. Rather than subtract pointers from one another, use an index variable of the same size as the pointers in question. Using this variable, "walk" from one pointer to the other and calculate the difference. Always sanity check this number.
