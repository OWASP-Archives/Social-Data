==How do we get started?==

The first step is to create a framework for a healthy security ecosystem! Then we can choose a few key technologies and vendors that want to work with us to start.  We need to pull together the materials we have and other materials out on the net into a OWASP Security Ecosystem Portal. To grow the ecosystem, weâ€™ll solicit research, tools, and other materials and work with both end-users and the vendor to focus on eliminating the key risks associated with the technology.

==The future!==

This could mark the dawning of a new collaborative era of application security, where companies actively engage with security researchers in order to make their products better. Everyone benefits by creating an ecosystem focused on fostering transparency. The time has come for security experts and software developers to collaborate. The stakes are way too high to waste time and effort on obscurity and infighting.
