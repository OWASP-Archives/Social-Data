We had some techical diffictulties with our projector setup, but were able to overcome it due to the small crowd. The presentation was very interesting and the speaker was Class One. Thanks Steve for a great / informative presentation. Below is a link to the slideshow portion of the presentation for anyone intersted in the topic to view. We are looking forward to our next meeting, hoping some time in February / March. Stay tuned.
