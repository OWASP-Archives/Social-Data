The objective of the global chapters survey is to communicate abroad with all the chapter leaders on topics of concern and where they need help. The survey will also go into depth on "what works" and what doesn't work so we can share knowledge between all the chapter leaders.

The survey will probably be completed through survey monkey or similar online format, were we can also make the results available to everyone. The survey should take a chapter leader no longer then 15-20 minutes to complete. Questions will be prepared and reviewed by '''TBD''', with the survey being released in '''TBD'''. It is expected that all chapter leaders will have approximately 7 days to complete and return.
