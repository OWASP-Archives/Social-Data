On Wednesday, 2nd June 2010, OWASP will hold its third annual "Front Range OWASP Conference (FROC)" in Denver, Colorado.

The Conference consists of a single day of Application Security sessions with 2 different tracks.

In 2009, we attracted a packed venue with our great AppSec speakers, and we hope to achieve the same again in 2010. This year we are organizing the conference with the support of our colleagues at the [http://www.cloudsecurityalliance.org/ Cloud Security Alliance], and will feature an AppSec track as well as a CloudSec/VirtSec track.

We are seeking presentations on any of the following topics:

* Application Security
** Web Services and Application Security
** Common Application related Threats and Risks
** Business Risks with Application Security
** Vulnerability Research in Application Security
** Web Application Penetration Testing
** Secure Coding Practices
** Browser Security
* "Cloud" Security
** Identity Management in the Cloud
** Incident response in the Cloud
** New cloud-based malicious threats
** Virtualization Security
** Transparency and Auditing in the Cloud


The official closing date for receiving a synopsis of the presentation is 31 March 2010, with announcements on selected candidates to be provided by <s>16</s> 23 April 2010. Complete presentations must be submitted by 21 May 2010.
