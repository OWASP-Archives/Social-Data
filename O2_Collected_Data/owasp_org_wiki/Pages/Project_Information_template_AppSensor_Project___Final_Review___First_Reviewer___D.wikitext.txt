"The concept of the AppSensor is to detect malicious activity within
an application before a user is able to identify and exploit a
vulnerability. This objective is possible because many vulnerabilities
will only be discovered as a result of trial and error by the
attacker."

For clarity, the introduction needs to standardize on some terms to
carry through the remainder of the document. Specifically, you need a
way to differentiate an innocent, application user from a malicious
application user.

In the response section, you start to discuss the possible causes of
an alert: unintentional, suspicious, malicious. You then have a
bulleted list that uses sightly different terminology, but seems to
indicate all cases are malicious. This need clarification.

"Malicious Intent
Possible User Error
Possible Attack
Clear Malicious Activity
"
Maybe instead of saying "malicious activity" call it "detected
activity", then go on to discuss how it will be classified as
malicious or not.
