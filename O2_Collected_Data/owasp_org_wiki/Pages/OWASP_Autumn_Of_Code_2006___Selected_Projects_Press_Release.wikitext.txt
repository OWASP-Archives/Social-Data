For Immediate Release 

'''OWASP Autumn of Code 2006'''

'''London, United Kingdom, September 29, 2006 '''

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has recently launched a new project entitled "OWASP Autumn of Code 2006” that is aimed at financially sponsoring contributions to OWASP Projects. 

On the 18th of September our call for entries ended and on the 25th of September we released our list of selected projects to be sponsored. OWASP has made the decision to sponsor 9 projects (5 at $3,500 USD and 4 at $5,000 USD) instead of our originally planned number of 8. We are pleased to report about the exceptional quality of the submissions that were received and we would also like to thank everyone who took the time and effort to submit their ideas to us. It was difficult narrowing the list down to the final 9 projects chosen, and we hope those that were not sponsored will resubmit their ideas in future OWASP sponsorships.
