 Our next meeting in March 21, 2012 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm, at 110 State Street, Albany, NY. 

We will be meeting in the 3rd floor conference room. I will be giving an overview of OWASP.

Since we will be meeting in a secure building, please RSVP to donna.vnuk@gmail.com before 12:00 noon the day of the event so that she can advise the Security Guards to allow your admittance. You will not be admitted to the building otherwise.

Thank you and look forward to seeing you at the meeting.
