 '''March Chapter Meeting'''
Our next chapter meeting will take place on Tuesday, March 13, from 5-7pm at ICC East Campus room TC-317.  We will be holding a joint meeting with the Adobe Users Group and will focus on both Injection Attacks and spend some time on the OWASP Flash Security Project (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Flash_Security_Project) 


 '''Meeting Roundup'''
Big Thank You's for everyone who attended our meeting last week.  We had a bigger turnout than I had anticipated for our first meeting and hope that you all found it to be very valuable.  If so, please let your friends, coworkers, etc.. know about the group and invite them to come to our next meeting in March.  

After tallying the surveys it appears that the majority of people would like to see meetings every two months, have some knowledge on AppSec topics, and are planning on joining OWASP as paid members.  When you do so please be sure to mark that you are signing up for the Peoria chapter so that we can start to get some funds into our account!  

Comments that were left behind centered around wanting to have our meetings center on technical and practical demonstrations, updates on current events in the security world, and making sure we take Cloud and Mobile development into consideration when we plan our sessions.

Our next meeting will center on Injection Attacks, explanations of what they are, how they are exploited, and samples of code that can be exploited.  I'm looking for a space to hold the meeting and am open to anyone with a space big enough for 20 people and a projector.

Thank you all!
Joe
