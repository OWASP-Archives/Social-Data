The [https://ocms.owasp.org OWASP Conference Management System] (OCMS) was designed to take in applications for all non-chapter meeting events, vett them through the Global Conferences Committee , and schedule them. This serves as the "official" starting point for all (non-chapter meeting) OWASP events.  Currently, most of the functionality of the system is in the [https://ocms.owasp.org/events/ Event Manager] however additional modules are planned for the future.  All OWASP events using the OWASP brand and wishing to use OWASP Foundation resources (money, schwag, content etc) must register their event via OCMS and have it approved by the [[Global Conferences Committee]]

Much of this system's functionality requires users to be logged in. Anyone can easily [https://ocms.owasp.org/accounts/register/ signup] for an account and is welcome to put forth an application to host an OWASP event. For more information on hosting an OWASP event see the [[How to Host a Conference]] page.

=Event Manager=
The [https://ocms.owasp.org/events/ Event Manager] is the principle starting point for using OCMS.  The main page has 4 major elements
* Upcoming Events - This lists all of the currently approved events on the OWASP event calendar
* Your Events - This lists all events for which you are listed as an event planner
* Events Under Review - This lists all events for which you are listed as an event planner that are still under review by the GCC (For superusers, this is all events under review)
* Actions - Currently, the only action is to submit a new event proposal


The event manager also interfaces with the [http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=hl6cjgs6ep1h7oniqgueu2bhbo%40group.calendar.google.com OWASP Event calendar].  Once an event is approved, an entry will automatically be placed in this calendar with some basic event details.  When an event planner updates their event, the [http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=hl6cjgs6ep1h7oniqgueu2bhbo%40group.calendar.google.com OWASP Event calendar] will also be updated automatically.
