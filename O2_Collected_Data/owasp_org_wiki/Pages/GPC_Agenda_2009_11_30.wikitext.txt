*Reviewers Drive, 
** [http://globalprojectscommittee.wordpress.com/2009/11/27/new-drive-for-project-reviewers/ Brad's Post],
**Next phase?
***Maybe the next phases of this process could consist in pushing it forward by using [[OWASP Project Reviewers Database|'''this page''']] to describe the review job role and, thereafter, by doing a call for reviewers through our leaders' mailing list.
----
*The [[:Category:OWASP Top Ten Project|'''OWASP Top Ten Project''']] is almost ready to be reviewed against the assessment criteria 2.0 and so we will need either a Board or a GPC member to act as Second Reviewer. Do we have any volunteers?
----
*Eduardo Neves from the Brazilian Chapter asks if his company can be considered [[:Category:Software Assurance Maturity Model|'''SAAM Project''']]'s sponsor if he allocates two of his company employees to translate it Portuguese. He also more broadly asks how does a sponsorship work.

== From Previous Meeting/Follow up  ==
