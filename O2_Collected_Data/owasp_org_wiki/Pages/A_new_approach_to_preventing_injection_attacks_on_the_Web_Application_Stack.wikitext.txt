== The presentation  ==

[[Image:Owasp_logo_normal.jpg|right]]Code injection vulnerabilities such as, SQL injection, javascript injection, byte-code injection, etc… constitute the most susceptible path of entry for rogue hackers into the corporate networks of an organization. This paper discusses the core components of Web Application code-injection attacks; the limitations of existing approaches (such as regular expression searches) to prevent such attacks; the paper introduces a new  generalized approach to solving the code-injection problem by building new solution vectors based on  compiler theory, in particular GLR parser theory combined with learning engines to solve the attack identification problem.  An brief introduction to Trustifier ryū is provided as an example of practical implementation of the theories and concepts put forth in this paper.
