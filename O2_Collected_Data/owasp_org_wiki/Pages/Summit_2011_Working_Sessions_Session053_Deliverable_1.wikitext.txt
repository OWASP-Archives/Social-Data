== '''Deliverable 1''' ==

'''Action plan for the Java Project''' 

# compile a list of OWASP projects related to Java (done in parallel to the other activities)
# define criteria so we can compare frameworks
## use known vulnerabilities
## use ASVS
# Reach frameworks to gather information on how they address the criteria items
# compile results
# replan based on the results

It was also decided to keep the Java project and the .Net project aligned as much as possible.
