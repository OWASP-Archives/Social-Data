Notes from the OWASP Washington chapter meeting where we discussed:

* Java Applet - very old technology, runs in sandbox
* Flash 7 - old flash movie environment
* JFX (Sun Java) - New scripting language compiles to bytecode, runs via Java Web Start
* Silverlight (Microsoft) - .NET Applets that run inside the browser, no privileged code
* Google Gears - local storage component with JavaScript API (Same Origin all the way down)
* AIR (Adobe - formerly Apollo) - VM that runs Flash, Shockwave movies, ActionScript, JavaScript, FLV

==Threat Agents to Consider==

* Threat from external attackers against your desktop application
* Threat from an attacker against back end systems
* Threat from malicious developers

==References==

AIR - http://www.flashsec.org, http://www.wisec.it/en/Docs/flash_App_testing_Owasp07.swf

==Results==

Key
* (Y) - Allowed by RIA framework
* (LF) - Limited by framework (a built in limitation or control)
* (LSO) - Limited by same origin policy (special built in policy)
* (LD) - Limited by developer (specified in a policy file like security.policy, jnlp, or crossdomain.xml)
* (LU) - Limited by user (specified in a policy file)
* (N) - Denied by RIA framework
