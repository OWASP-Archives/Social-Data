| project_name = OWASP Enterprise Security API
| project_description = ESAPI (The OWASP Enterprise Security API) is a free, open source, web application security control library that makes it easier for programmers to write lower-risk applications. The ESAPI libraries are designed to make it easier for programmers to retrofit security into existing applications. The ESAPI libraries also serve as a solid foundation for new development. Allowing for language-specific differences, all OWASP ESAPI versions have the same basic design:

* '''There is a set of security control interfaces.''' They define for example types of parameters that are passed to types of security controls. 

* '''There is a reference implementation for each security control.''' The logic is not organization‐specific and the logic is not application‐specific. An example: string‐based input validation.

* '''There are optionally your own implementations for each security control.''' There may be application logic contained in these classes which may be developed by or for your organization. An example: enterprise authentication.
