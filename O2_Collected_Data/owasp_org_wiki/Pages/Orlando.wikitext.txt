8:00 - ? After event social gathering - Location TBD

 

*Tom Brennan is a Director at Spiderlabs/Trustwave, an OWASP Global Board Member and Chapter Leader for OWASP NY/NJ Metro. His talk is "OWASP Where are we... Where are we going in 2012"
*Jim Manico is the VP of Security Architecture for WhiteHat Security, a web security firm.  Jim is a participant and project manager of the OWASP Developer Cheatsheet series. He is also the producer and host of the OWASP Podcast Series. This talk will discuss the past methods used for cross-site scripting (XSS) defense that were only partially effective. Learning from these lessons, we will also discuss present day defensive methodologies that are effective, but place an undue burden on the developer. We will then finish with a discussion of future XSS defense mythologies that shift the burden of XSS defense from the developer to various frameworks. These include auto-escaping template technologies, browser-based defenses such as Content Security Policy, and Javascript sandboxes such as the Google CAJA project and JSReg.

 

Refreshments will be provided at the event and have been donated by Security Innovation.

Inaugural Meeting October 19, 2011 6:30 PM at Seasons 52

We will be holding our first meeting on October 19 for an informal gathering of those interested in the OWASP mission. This is a chance to get to know the other members of the chapter and engage in the initial dialogue that will drive the direction of the group. We want to know what kinds of technologies you use or are interested in learning about, the challenges you are facing in your daily work and get a sense for the types of content you want to see at future meetings. I will bring some copies of various OWASP guides and possibly some other OWASP shwag to this initial meeting. We will be covering the OWASP mission, culture, and a high level view of OWASP projects. The format for this meeting will largely be discussion oriented. This is not currently a sponsored event, but we do have interested parties asking about sponsorship opportunities so this may change.

*Meeting Date: October 19, 2011 6:30 PM til whenever 
*Meeting Location: Seasons 52 in Orlando, FL at 7700 W Sand Lake Rd.
