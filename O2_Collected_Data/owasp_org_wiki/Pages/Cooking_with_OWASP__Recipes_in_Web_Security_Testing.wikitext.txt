==The Presentation: "Cooking with OWASP: Recipes in Web Security Testing"==

Many of the OWASP projects are tools that you can use to test web applications directly., but not just from a security assessor’s point of view. Software testers need to be able to work security testing into their day-to-day testing regimen. In this talk, Paco will show you a few recipes from his recently released “Web Security Testing Cookbook” that feature OWASP tools. You’ll see how to cheat at some Facebook games by decoding their data with CAL9000, how to assess session ID strength using WebScarab, and how to fuzz web services with wsFuzzer. This talk is all about how to get some actionable hands-on results from some outstanding OWASP tools.
