| align="center" style="width:20%; background:#cccccc" | Austin OWASP Membership Director, LASCON Volunteer 
| align="center" style="width:57%; background:#cccccc" | Josh and I have worked together through the Austin OWASP chapter for the last 5 years. He has been a tremendous individual contributor to the security community - but specifically - has been a huge proponent for OWASP in Texas. He has supported each of the growing chapters in Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio - as well as his efforts in Austin with our local chapter. In addition, Josh (and James Wickett) took it upon themselves to start the LASCON conference, which in its first year was a trememdous success. Finally - Josh is reliable. When he says he is going to do something - it gets done. I reccomend Josh for this role and believe he would be a benefit to this committee.&nbsp;

| align="center" style="width:57%; background:#cccccc" | Josh has proven his ability time and again to accomplish great things. He does what he sets out to do, and because of this he has contributed greatly to the huge success of the Austin OWASP chapter as well as the tremendous success of the LASCON conference. I highly recommend Josh and believe that his efforts on any committee would be highly valued and effective.

| align="center" style="width:57%; background:#cccccc" | As President of the Austin OWASP chapter, Josh has been instrumental in building the Austin OWASP chapter to be a vibrant and active chapter. His leadership in building the local chapter is commendable and I strongly feel that his experience would be a valuable fit for the Global Chapter committee. Josh comes with my highest recommendations.
