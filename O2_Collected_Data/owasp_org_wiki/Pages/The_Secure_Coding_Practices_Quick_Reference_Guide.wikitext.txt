== The presentation  ==

[[Image:Keith_T_238x333.jpg|right]]Introducing a new OWASP project, "The Secure Coding Practices Quick Reference Guide". The guide is a technology agnostic set of software security coding practices, in a comprehensive checklist format, that can be integrated into the development life-cycle. At only 13 pages long, it is easy for development teams to read and use. The coding practices are mapped to functional requirements, so you can quickly locate the practices you need. It also provides a brief introduction to security principles and vocabulary to help developers and security folks get on the same page, but the focus is on requirements not vulnerabilities or exploits. This presentation will provide an overview of the guide and discuss some concepts about how to use it.
