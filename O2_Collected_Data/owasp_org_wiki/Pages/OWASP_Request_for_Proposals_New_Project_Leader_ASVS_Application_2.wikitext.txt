| Proposed_Roadmap_Text = OWASP Ottawa Chapter Leader and co-founder since 2006. One of the main contributor to WebGoat 5.0. Coming from a software development, management and security background positions me as a strong candidate to take this project to the next level. My view to this project includes three main areas with equal importance: 1. Maturity: maturing this project into a product like project with documented and illustrated process 2. Visibility: Integrating this project into other OWASP material and defining where would the other OWASP projects fit within the model 3. Adoption: case studies and focusing the light on the success stories with organizations already using the project.
