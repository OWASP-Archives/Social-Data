In this presentation the authors of the xprobe will demonstrate all the cool features that are implemented in new generation of this tool. This includes completely re-engineered module execution and scheduling algorithm that focuses on minimizing number of network probes during the fingerprinting. Additionally new application-level modules will be discussed and practical usage demonstrated.
