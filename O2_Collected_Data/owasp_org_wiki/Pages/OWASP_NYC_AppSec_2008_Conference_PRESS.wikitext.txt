<h1>OWASP Event Press Registration</h1>

Press registration is open to any member of the broadcast, print and Internet media who can prove they work for an organization or publication that covers computer security on a regular basis. At the conference we will provide a press room with Internet access and electrical outlets for laptop computers. If you need a separate room for filming interviews, please request it in advance in the comments section. Let us know if there are any other special needs such as speakers you want to interview when you arrive or other items such as computer access to file stories or a fax machine.


We welcome anyone to apply for press credentials but reserve the right to deny you a pass. As such, please be prepared to show us copies of your articles either at your publication's Web site or on the publication's masthead should we request it.


At the show, please be able to present a business card, and government issued picture id, article on your organization's masthead and contact information for your assignment editor should we need it to validate your credentials before issuing you a pass.


Press registration may be granted for the seminars only.
There are no press passes available for Training.


Please make a point to pre-register. Should you attempt to attain credentials on-site, we cannot guarantee you will qualify and must bring all information in the above paragraph.
