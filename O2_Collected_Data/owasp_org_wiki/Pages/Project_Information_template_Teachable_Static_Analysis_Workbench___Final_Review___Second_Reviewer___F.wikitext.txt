Install guide is great. Very easy to use and installation took <10 minutes!

Consider create a "getting Started" section on the ProjectOverview page and include the install guide and user guide links here.

Within the UsersGuide, include a link to download the project you are using for the examples.

To help distinguish the output of TeSA from the findbugs results prepend all TeSA findings with "TeSA". This will help identify what TeSA is doing that findbugs was not able to do.

I'd recommend creating some documentation and perhaps example code which illustrates what TeSA can do that existing tools, such as findbugs, cannot. Since this is a new tool it is important to "sell" it to a new user. Why should they use this tool instead of others, what benefits and capabilities does TeSA have that other tools don't.
