===I am not receiving any compilation errors in Eclipse, but my web server can't find ESAPI===
* Be sure that ESAPI is being exported to your web server when the server starts. To do this:
# Right-click your project in the Navigator and choose "Properties".
# Select "Java EE Module Dependencies" from the list on the left.
# If the ESAPI JAR is already listed, be sure it is checked off on the list.
# If the ESAPI JAR is not listed, add it with "Add JAR" or "Add External JAR".
# Save and restart your web server.
