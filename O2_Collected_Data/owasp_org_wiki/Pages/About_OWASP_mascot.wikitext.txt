This page is a place holder for the OWASP Mascot - [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mascot Defined]  OWASP Foundation has a WASP associated with it as a "Bug" hence bug in software.  We are looking for a mascot and created this page to work out some artistic suggestions

Taking this as a baseline 
[http://www.crestock.com/image/2932189-Fighting-Wasp-Mascot.aspx Click Here], i would suggest adding a keyboard to his hands, giving him traditional geek glasses and a fly swatter to eradicate other bugs.  When completed it would visualize the associated creature (wasp) and provide for a symbol of the professional community that can be used for things such as: stickers, logos, action figures ;)  - Tom Brennan

[https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Live_CD_Project Option B] - Some owasp art work is already in place at the live cd project. We could adapt this. Don't know the original artist.

[[User:Psiinon|Psiinon]]: Mascots tend to be cartoon characters don't they? That would favor ones like Option A.
