The goal of this project is to contribute teaching material for teaching Kids on the web application security. The teaching material can be in the format of Power Point, Video, World document or any other format. The goal is to teach kids to use search tool, e-mail, facebook, blog, or general browsing safely. As an initial attempt, I will upload an initial power point document (coming soon) as the reference and I welcome any new contributors to this project.
