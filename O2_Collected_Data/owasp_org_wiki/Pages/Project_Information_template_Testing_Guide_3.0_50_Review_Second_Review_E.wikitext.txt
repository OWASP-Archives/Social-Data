1. At what extent have the project deliveries & objectives been accomplished?  Having in consideration [[OWASP Testing Project v3 Roadmap|'''the assumed ones''']], please exemplify writing down those of them that haven't been realised.

The Project is well on it's way to completion.  I read the various edits side by side with thier version 2 versions.  I see how the content changes will make the end product easier to read and understand.  The new additions, including the new attack vectors and testing methodologies, will help keep the guide current. The various new additions in the attack vectors and testing methodologies mentioned by reviewer one remain the primary uncompleted tasks.

2. At what extent have the project deliveries & objectives been accomplished?  Having in consideration [[OWASP Testing Project v3 Roadmap|'''the assumed ones''']], please quantify in terms of percentage.

Considering the progress on the reorganization (90%)  I would mark the project at 60% done.

It would be usful, though maybe not practical, to somehow highlight the changes made when re-editing exisiting content? Reading side by side with the version 2 in order to identify the content added or changed was very time consuming and tiring.  Also there were a couple of spelling and grammar errors I noted in passing.  Nothing big but cause for note.
