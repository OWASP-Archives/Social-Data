I'm an independent developer of Ruby on Rails web applications and a student pursuing a masters of software engineering at the University of North Florida here in Jacksonville, Florida. I've concentrated my studies in secure development of web applications and recently completed a directed independent study entitled Security Testing 1st Tier Components of Web Applications. I'm very excited about the successful completion of this second version of OWASP Ruby on Rails Security.
