== General ==

The OWASP Hartford 2008 conference will be held in November 2008 at the headquarters of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. We are raising the bar and will be holding a full day '''two tracks''' event. The tracks would be split according to background: Business & IT Management and IT Professionals.

== Call for participation ==

Being a community event, we are staring a call for involvement, which means it is the time to speak up if you want to:

* Speak in the event [[OWASP_Hartford_CFP|(details)]]
* Sponsor the event [[OWASP Hartford Sponsorship|(details)]]
* Help in organizing
* Otherwise participate (plenty of time for that, but if you know you will come, speak up)

'''This is also a good time to raise other ideas you have regarding the conference'''. Many of you have been to previous conferences and have great ideas, so don't be shy and speak up.

== Content Committee ==

The content committee that will select the presentations and review selected presentations will include:

* James McGovern (The Hartford)

You can read more about the content committee role in the [[OWASP_Hartford_CFP|CFP page]]
