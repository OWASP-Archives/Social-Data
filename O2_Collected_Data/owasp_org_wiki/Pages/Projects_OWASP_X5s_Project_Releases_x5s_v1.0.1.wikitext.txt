| release_description =
x5s was first and foremost designed to find encoding and character transformation issues that can lead to XSS vulnerability, and present them in a visual way where they could be reviewed with a quickness. Many tools exist for testing Web-applications to find cross-site scripting bugs. There are browser plugins, Web-scanners, and static code analyzers. We use whatever suits us in a given situation and produces the output we're interested in receiving. We developed x5s for penetration testers and other security-minded persons who already know how to find and exploit an XSS vulnerability. The tool has a slightly different bent than other tools we've used. 

It's main goals include: 
* Automate finding the encoding issues that can lead to XSS. 
* Identify where character transformations occur by injecting multibyte characters such as higher Unicode code points and non-shortest form character encodings.
