== Questions ==
#Would you care to tell us how did you get into IT and what lead you into a career in information security? What keeps you busy these days?
#What's the difference between focusing on threats vs focusing on vulnerabilities?
#What is your problem with the "protect the data" mindset?
#What do you mean by "building visibility in"?
#What is your take on the Aurora/Google hack?
#You just tweeted that "Network Security Monitoring ideology is the proper mechanism to combat APT/APA".  Do you think network IPS/IDS/WAF can help defend insecure web applications? What are the limits of Network Security Monitoring?
#How important a role do you think secure coding and secure software development life-cycle play in defending the enterprise?
#Have HIPAA, PCI, SOX and other regulations helped reduce risk in the average enterprise? 
#Is seems pretty clear that attackers have a clear advantage. Why is that?  How can we turn the tide?
#Any thoughts on OWASP? Are we helping the cause?
#Where are we going to be as an industry in 10 years?
#You blogged that "The trustworthiness of a digital asset is limited by the owner's capability to detect incidents compromising the integrity of that asset." Given that we don't have any high integrity database, identities or application servers - how do you detect a breach of integrity when there is no verifiable integrity in the system in the first place?
