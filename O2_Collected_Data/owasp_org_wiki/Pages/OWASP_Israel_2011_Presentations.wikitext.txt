=== Composite Applications Over Hybrid Clouds – Enterprise Security Challenges of the IT Supply Chain  ===

'''''[http://www.ca.com/us/about-us/Innovation/ca-labs/people/ethan-hadar.aspx Dr. Ethan Hadar], Senior Vice President Corporate Technical Strategy, CA''''' 

Cloud Computing offerings range at several levels. Infrastructure, Platform, Business and Software services are consumed according to a pay per use “as a Service” manner, implementing the parts of a service supply chain. The services range from dedicated single SaaS applications such as sales force, or using an isolated utility computing such as accessing an IaaS virtual image on Amazon or Rackspace, or composing your own application on PaaS platform such as Azure or Force.com. All these offerings enable to create compound solutions over hybrid clouds, in which the parts of the integrated composite applications are provided from several different vendors and suppliers with different quality attributes, including application security.  The provider of the composite application is responsible for the overall quality levels, and is expected to verify the security quality levels of each sub-element, as well as be able to verify and prove its existence to the composite applications consumers. 

Or is it not the case?

The programmable web creates many challenges.  Even if the author of the composite applications detects application security issues within the supply chain, can a remedy and a change occur? Is the author even allowed to try and verify (hack) the provided public services, in order to verify its own obligations, and by that, exposing the provider to other opportunistic hackers?

Consequently, there are many challenges:   what are the potential breaches in a supply chain? Can a chain reaction of hacking occur? What does “secure enough” supply chain means? At what level (IaaS, PaaS, BSaaS, SaaS) should we test the sub-services? Are we allowed to? What happens if we find an issue? How do we wrap security fences on top of a non-secured sub-services? What are the sub-contracted obligations that may be solved legally or financial wise? If a change occurs, what are the implications to the running connected systems? Should the sub-provider quality levels affect the consumer, or can the consumer impose security requirements on the provider? If there is a remedy plan, how can it be executed and verified, who will pay for the expenses? Who will manage the hardening project?

In this keynote, we will present the environment and its challenges, highlighting potential solutions, dilemmas or directions, all in order to generate an open Q&A discussion with the forum.

=== Finding Security in Misery of Others  ===

'''''Amichai Shulman, CTO, Imperva'''''

We frequently read about different security incidents, including data breaches, attacks and other hacks. The details of these incidents enable us to learn from others. However, most of the news reports regarding security breaches are vague and nebulous. This session will explain how to "Read between the Lines" of press reports on security breaches. The presentation will demonstrate, using past security incident reports, how to understand the attack methods, the compromised services, and the different applied security policies at the attack location. The session will also describe mitigation techniques that might have been helpful in a specific incident. Examples breaches will focus on hacking techniques that span search engines, SQL injection and data theft.

This "Behind the Scenes" perspective, will illustrate the important failure points, how to find information regarding the detection process, and analyze the effectiveness of the audit trail in the incident. Finally, the presenter will suggest some preventive measures to avoid similar breaches. The attendees will learn how to diagnose the attack scenario in order to apply and test the correct security controls in their system to prevent a similar mishap at their site.

=== CMS and Other Giants – The Nightmare of AppSec Testing  ===

'''''Irene Abezgauz, Product Manager, Seeker Security'''''

Large, established web applications are often in the news these days after being hacked. The CISOs in charge of these applications test their security routinely, so how did this happen?

Content Management Systems, CRMs, Portals and other applications that have grown to enormous proportions over time are a challenge to application security testing. This is caused by the sheer amount of components, URLs, parameters and data flow, not to mention frequent changes, trust in 3rd party components and new code introduced without anybody’s knowledge! 

Focusing on real world technical examples and newly discovered vulnerabilities, we will present the challenges of testing very large applications, and explain how even trivial vulnerabilities can often get overlooked.

=== When Crypto Goes Wrong  ===

'''''Erez Metula, Founder, AppSec Labs '''''

Cryptography, when implemented properly, can solve many day-to-day security tasks such as confidentially, integrity, authentication, secure random number generation, and so on. But the problem is, too many things can go wrong…

In this presentation we'll examine some of the most common mistakes developers tend to do when dealing with crypto. During the presentation we'll examine the influence of mistakes such as failure to verify a certificate, replay attacks, client side encryption, crypto DoS, and so on.

In other words, we'll see how attackers can break crypto based mechanisms deployed in applications without breaking the crypto itself – but just going around them.

=== Security Testing of RESTful Services ===

'''''Ofer Shezaf, Head of AppSec Research, HP'''''

'''''Eyal Fingold, Senior Security Developer, HP'''''

RESTful services have become popular for emerging platforms. Less resource intensive and simpler than traditional web services, RESTful services are a particularly good fit for low footprint mobile and tablet applications, as well as for web 2.0 sites offering an interface for 3rd party developers.

Upon first glance, RESTful services seem very different than web services and suspiciously similar to regular web technology. This similarity leads to the common belief that securing RESTful services is similar to securing regular web applications. However, RESTful services hide the same complexities of web services, albeit with a much lower level of formal documentation.

The presentation will provide an overview of RESTful services, development frameworks using RESTful services, and the formal methods to document them, including WADL and WSDL 2.0. The speaker will discuss complexities in protecting RESTful services, and describe variants of common attack vectors that are specific to REST services,for example, embedding attack vectors in the URL and permutation of HTTP verbs. We conclude the with a discussion of the challenges of testing RESTful services for security issues and describe innovative ideas for discovering the RESTful service attack surface using black-box penetration testing, and a hybrid method often called grey-box testing to enhance this discovery.

=== Temporal Session Race Conditions  ===

'''''Shay Chen, CTO, Hacktics Advanced Security Center, Ernst & Young'''''

The ones you trust most will always be the worst – anonymous weirdo, Myspace.

Temporary session values were never considered a potential attack vector, especially if their lifespan was limited to a single method… but now this theoretical attack becomes a reality. 

The session memory is used by applications to store various values, which are used in turn to enforce security restrictions or share information between multiple entry points. Some of these values are temporary; their lifespan often limited to the execution context of a single page or method, which uses these values to store information for its own calculations, and then disposes of them. 

Using these values to perform any sort of attack is a process that was considered nearly impossible, purely theoretical, and very hard to reproduce. However, using a new technique, which combines nearly four different application level attacks, this potential can become a reality – an exposure that can be reproduced in a reliable and repeatable manner.

=== Space-Time Tradeoffs in Software-Based Deep Packet Inspection  ===

'''''Yotam Harchol, IDC''''' 

Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) lies at the core of contemporary Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). DPI aims to identify various malware by inspecting both the header and the payload of each packet and comparing it to a known set of patterns. DPI is often performed on the critical path of the packet processing, thus the overall performance of the security tools is dominated by the speed of DPI.

The Aho-Corasick (AC) algorithm is the de-facto standard for pattern matching in NIDS. Basically, the AC algorithm constructs a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) for detecting all occurrences of a given set of patterns by processing the input in a single pass. The input is inspected symbol by symbol, such that each symbol results in a state transition. Thus, in principle, the AC algorithm has deterministic performance, which does not depend on specific input and therefore is not vulnerable to algorithmic complexity attacks, making it very attractive.

In this talk I will show that, when implementing the AC algorithm in software, this property does not hold, due to the fact that contemporary pattern sets induce very large DFAs that cannot be stored entirely in cache. We propose a novel technique to compress the representation of the AC automaton, so it can fit in modern cache. We compare both the performance and the memory footprint of our technique to previously-proposed implementation, under various settings and pattern sets. Our results reveal the space-time tradeoffs of DPI. Specifically, we show that our compression technique reduces the memory footprint of the best prior-art algorithm by approximately 60%, while achieving comparable throughput.

=== Glass Box Testing - Think Inside the Box  ===

'''''Omri Weisman, Manager, Security Research Group, IBM'''''

Automatically scanning for web application security vulnerabilities is traditionally performed either using a white box approach or using a black box approach. Each of the two approaches has its pros and cons. An exciting new technology called glass box is emerging as a way to enjoy the benefits of both approaches and beyond. Glass box technology allows observing the behavior of the application from within while scanning the application, providing the missing bridge between black box and white box. Research shows that this approach can greatly augment key aspects of black box scanning such as the logical coverage of scanned applications, as well as the detection of previously undetected security issues. This lecture presents some of the most painful challenges automated tools are facing nowadays as well as innovative approaches for solving them.
