<li> <b>Mike Bailey</b> is an Application Security Specialist and researcher who has 
been looking into CSRF, XSS, and other underappreciated security bugs in 
web applications.  As the Information Security Officer for a web 
development firm, much of his time goes into educating developers and 
project managers on secure application development.  He has disclosed 
critical bugs in many popular web applications, from cPanel's Web 
Hosting Manager to Facebook.  Mike is better at breaking things than 
fixing them, and has been described as "a good guy, with an evil mind."</li>
