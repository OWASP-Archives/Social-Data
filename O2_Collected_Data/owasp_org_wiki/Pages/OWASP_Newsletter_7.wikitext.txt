== Featured Item 1: [[OWASP Spring Of Code 2007]] ==

Following the success of last year's Autumn of Code (AoC 06) we are are now launching the OWASP Spring of Code 2007 (SpoC 007) with more budget, more energy and more expectations :)

Here are the main links for this initiative: 
* [[OWASP Spring Of Code 2007]] - main page 
* [[OWASP Spring Of Code 2007 : Press Release]] - The press release 
* [[OWASP Spring Of Code 2007 Project Ideas]] - If you are looking for projects to do 
* [[OWASP Spring Of Code 2007 Applications]] - Where to submit Applications 
* [[OWASP Spring Of Code 2007 : Selection]] - The selection criteria and links to each selected project page 

== Featured Item 2: [[:Category:OWASP Chapter|OWASP Chapters]] ==

Currently there are over 80 OWASP chapters world wide! The OWASP chapters program helps to foster local discussion of application security around the world. Our local chapters are free and open to anyone. Check out the [[:Category:OWASP Chapter|chapters page]] to locate a chapter near you or start a new chapter.

There are a lot of resources available for all chapters: The [[Chapter Rules|Chapter Rules]], the OWASP [[Chapter Leader Handbook|Chapter Leader Handbook ]] and if you are short of local chapter material, we have started to make available presentations in the monthly [[Chapter Presentation Bundles|Chapter Presentation Bundles]].

An extra call for action towards the OWASP (chapter) leaders: If you are in other countries/cities and you would like to participate in a local chapter
meeting, do not hesitate to contact the local chapter leader!

Also have a look at the great [[Phoenix/Tools]] page, created by the [[Phoenix]] chapter.

== Featured Item 3: WASC Threat Classification Project - Call for Participants == 

The WASC Threat Classification Project is seeking people to contribute towards The Threat Classification Version 2.0. Time has passed since the initial TC release, and it's important to keep this widely utilized document up to date.

Project Homepage: http://www.webappsec.org/projects/threat/ 

Interested participants can contact 'contact_@_webappsec.org' with any questions.

== Featured Project: [[:Category:OWASP SWAAT Project|OWASP SWAAT Project]] ==
SWAAT is a free web application source code analysis tool. SWAAT searches through source code and analyzes against the database of potentially dangerous strings given in the .xml files. Thus it does NOT positively identify the existence of a vulnerability - this generally requires application contextual knowledge. It identifies the usage of functions / strings / SQL that could lead to a finding. All potentially dangerous code references are included in the output report. 

Future releases of SWAAT will include: 
* a graphical user interface (GUI)
* integrated development environment (IDE) plug-ins
* more sophisticated functionality and logic (for example to work with .java source)

SWAAT was generously donated by [http://www.securitycompass.com Security Compass]

== Featured Event: Application Security Track at Spring &lt;br /&gt; Conference 2007 (Athens, OH Mar-22) ==
Harden web applications against the OWASP "Top 10 Threats"!  The Spring &lt;br /&gt; Conference 2007 is held on Thursday, March 22, 2007 on the campus of Ohio University in Athens, Ohio. They have a dedicated Application Security track and more in this day long event that has been described as, "one of the best kept secrets in Information Technology!".  

At this event, the fifth annual, Joel Stanley of Resource Interactive, in Columbus, OH, will share his experiences in maintaining applications with user bases as large as 15+ million.  He'll explore how to utilize standards by which application security and vulnerability can be judged. Join hundreds of your IT professional peers in this and your choices of thirty-four other sessions in seven tracks at this day long event that costs only $35 (including your lunch!).  Ben Forta, Chief Product Evangelist of Adobe Systems will be giving the Key Note presentation, plus Ben will be back to give a presentation at the Lunchtime Session as well. Visit [http://www.sbconference.com http://www.sbconference.com] for all the details and to register online!

*'''Mar 15 - [http://aviv.raffon.net/2007/03/14/PhishingUsingIE7LocalResourceVulnerability.aspx local IE 7 phishing hole]'''
:Provides a nice proof of concept with CNN (Link at the bottom). "Internet Explorer 7.0 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting in one of its local resources. In combination with a design flaw in this specific local resource it is possible for an attacker to easily conduct phishing attacks against IE7 users." CNET News also picked this up as a [http://news.com.com/2100-1002_3-6167410.html?part=rss&tag=2547-1_3-0-20&subj=news story].
*'''Mar 14 -  [http://mybeni.rootzilla.de/mybeNi/2007/gmail_information_disclosure/ GMail Information Disclosure]'''
:Only a tiny XSS hole to demonstrate a disclosure proof-of-concept through AJAX/JSON of all contacts you ever mailed. If a domains covers a lot of functionality and users, one XSS can be devastating. Remember the Google Desktop vulnerability. What is frightening is that it took Beni only ~5 minutes to find a XSS hole.
*'''Mar 8 -  [http://myappsecurity.blogspot.com/search/label/reflection Anurag Agarwal's reflection series]'''
:Anurag Agarwal maintains an interesting [http://myappsecurity.blogspot.com/ blog] on Web Application Security. Recently he started a serie of reflections on people active in this field. Up until now he covered Amit Klein, RSnake, Jeremiah Grossman, Ivan Ristic and Sheeraj Shah. Lot's of good pointers to web application research of the last years!
