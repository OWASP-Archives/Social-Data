| summit_attendee_bio= Lucas has been a security professional for more than 15 years. He began working on network security and then security management. As he has several developers in the family, he got interested in secure development techniques. In 2008, he answer a Call for Trainings to be delivered at the first OWASP Summit and got the opportunity to go to Portugal and to know OWASP and its leaders. In 2009 he managed to put together the first AppSec Conference in South America and did it again in 2010. He is now more involved in OWASP than ever, having a seat at the Global Conferences Committee, leading the OWASP local chapter in Brasilia, DF, Brazil and leading the newborn OWASP Portuguese Project.
