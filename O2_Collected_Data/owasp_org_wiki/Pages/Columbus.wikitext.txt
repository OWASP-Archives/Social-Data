Creating the Business Case, An Essential Guide for the Security Practitioner

All too often, legitimate and critically required security initiatives fail to reach fruition. Oftentimes, this is due to a lack of communication and understanding between the security practitioner and the business owners. Jack Jones, SR VP of IT Risk, Huntington Bank, will describe in detail how practitioners can achieve greater success by clearly linking an improved security posture to the success of the enterprise.

Open Source Security Tools Your Team Is Not Using

The second a web application is published, your internal infrastructure is instantly exposed to vulnerabilities network-level protection can’t defend. Now that you’ve benefitted from our previous sessions information share of OWASP and the Top 10, we will dive into actual tactical mitigation tools available to help detect and mitigate the most common security vulnerabilities.

From WebGoat and WebScarab to VulnXML – OWASP has many free projects and web application security assessment tools, but which is right for your situation? The combination of Bill Sempf’s knowledge, Aaron Ansari’s practical application, tools and sample code (.NET) is just what you need to keep those hackers at bay.

Identity & Access Management

At JPMorgan Chase Bank the challenge of balancing business flexibility and regulatory compliance is paramount. In the Retail lines of business: Consumer and Business Banking, Chase Mortgage Banking, Chase Auto Financing, and Chase Student Lending, as well as the supporting technology teams, compliance controls heavily leverage the Identity & Access Management processes and tools. The IAM team is charged with providing governance and monitoring of the banks access controls across nearly 1000 applications and thousands of infrastructure assets with 1.4M distinct levels of access for 2.1M non distinct users. The only viable solution to effectively manage this volume of data is broad integration, automation, and a strategic push to on board all assets to the IAM tool suite.

== Meeting details  ==

Our chapter meets ''quarterly''; we're organizing several different event styles in addition to traditional presentations. There will be opportunities for Columbus OWASP members to meet other local security groups through event cross-participation and cooperation. The next quarterly meeting is being planned for August 18th, 2011. 

Feel free to contact us at columbusowasp@gmail.com with any questions.

Mark Feferman was our second speaker.  Mark has over 18 years of IT security experience beginning as one of the original four software developers of the BindView suite of products.  As a career software developer, who later became involved in IT security, Mark’s role as an application security professional is focused on strategic initiatives, like secure coding standards, threat modeling, and the integration of static code analysis into the SDLC.  Mark currently services as the practice director for Application Security at FishNet Security.  He, along with his 18 direct reports, located around the US, perform the advisory services for the practice.

Mark presented: Application Security…it’s not just a tactical effort…it’s both a Strategic and Tactical affair. This will include The State of Application Security: The Strategic, the Tactical, and the Do-Nothings, Consultant Perspectives: Application Security in the PCI World, and Secure SDLC, Where to Start, What are the essentials.

== Q3 Meeting August 18, 2011 at 1PM ==

On August 18, 2011, from 1PM to 4PM at the Conference Center of BMW Financial. Two speakers were featured:

Speaker: '''Brent Huston''' CEO & Security Evangelist of MicroSolved, Inc. (MSI)

This presentation will discuss PHP and ASP malware, discovery techniques, how the attackers are staging and processing malware-based attacks, as well as the relevance of anti-virus against these forms of malware. Drawn from real world attacks and compromises, examples will be displayed and discussed. Take aways will include the architecture of attacker cells, their targeting and use of compromised hosts and insight into how simple, basic controls can assist us in fighting these forms of assault.

Speaker: '''Kevin Wall''' - ESAPI Committer / Owner at OWASP & Staff Security Engineer at CenturyLink

[https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:OWASP_ESAPI-2011.ppt Kevin's Presentation and Materials]

OWASP Enterprise Security API (ESAPI) is one of the flagship projects at OWASP, but as of yet, not many application development teams have adopted it. This presentation will provide a brief history and overview of ESAPI, including its goals and all its language implementations, before taking a deeper dive into ESAPI for Java.

The ESAPI for Java portion will discuss major changes from ESAPI 1.4 to ESAPI 2.0 and how the various ESAPI 2.0 security controls map as mitigations for the OWASP Top Ten. We will also examine the relative maturity of each security control.

This will be followed by a few examples of how to use ESAPI, including an in-depth one of using ESAPI's symmetric encryption. Finally, we will briefly describe how the OWASP AppSensor project
has the ESAPI's Intrustion Detection mechanism to provid an powerful intrustion detection system at the application layer and describe some of the advantanges of this versus an more
traditional IDS.

== Q2 Meeting - June 10th, 1PM - Defensible .NET  ==

'''Presented by Jason Montgomery, Sr. Security Specialist, Active Technologies Group, Inc.''' 

ASP.NET and the .NET framework have become the preferred foundation underlying enterprise applications. While Microsoft has prioritized integrating security into the ASP.NET framework, attacks at the application layer are dramatically increasing. How effective are the security controls built into the ASP.NET framework? Application developers must understand the limitations of the framework and ensure their code is secure. Focusing on the OWASP top ten, Jason Montgomery will explain the latest defensive techniques specific to the ASP.NET environment. Jason is Sr. Security Specialist at Active Technologies Group, Inc. (ATGi). He is a SANS instructor in .NET application security and co-author of the secure coding certification, GSSP.NET. Jason has spent the past five years guiding software security practices at the Department of Defense, and currently leads ATGi’s secure software development and assessment practice. 

== 3rd Annual Central Ohio Infosec Summit  ==

The goal of this event is to educate regional Information Security professionals and support collaboration by bringing leading speakers in the information security field together to educate the community on the latest industry trends and issues. 

This Information Security Conference will provide information security professionals with the most up-to-date information, tools, trends, legislative information, products, services, and strategies for addressing information security issues. The conference will focus on key topics related to information security with presentations provided by recognized experts and exhibits by some of the nation’s leading organizations. 

== 2010 Q1 Meeting  ==

*'''PHP Security''' presented by Jon Canady, Web Application Developer, [http://www.innova-partners.com/ Innova Partners], March 23rd, 2010

'''Meeting Summary:''' PHP is a widely used, general-purpose scripting language, originally designed to produce dynamic web pages. In 2007, The PHP Group reported it was utilized on over 20 million websites and 1 million web servers. In 2008, the National Vulnerability Database claimed PHP accounted for 35% of software vulnerabilities, with nearly all caused by poor programming practices. Every PHP developer, hoster, and security professional should understand the primary attack vectors being used by attackers against PHP applications. During this OWASP meeting we dived deep into PHP security - specifically the OWASP Top 10 in the context of PHP. 

In addition to the presentation, chapter leadership changes were announced as well as the new leadership's plans for increasing the visibility and participation of the chapter. 

The Columbus OWASP Chapter leadership would like to thank [http://www.bmwfs.com/ BMW Financial Services] for hosting this event and [http://www.innova-partners.com/ Innova Partners] for providing lunch.
