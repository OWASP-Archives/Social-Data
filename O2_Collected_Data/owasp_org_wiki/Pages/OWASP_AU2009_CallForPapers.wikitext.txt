CALL FOR PAPERS - OWASP 2009 Gold Coast Australia.

February 25thâ€“27th 2009, OWASP will hold its annual Australia Application Security conference on the beautiful Gold Coast. The Conference consists of one day of training sessions, followed by a two-day conference with 3 different tracks.

In 2008, we attracted a number of local and international speakers, and hope to achieve the same again in 2009. We are also extending the number of available tracks so we can offer more presentations during the conference, and therefore more speaker opportunities as we simply ran out of space last year.

We are seeking presentations on any of the following topics:

*Web Services and Application Security
*Common Application related Threats and Risks seen in Asia Pacific
*Business Risks with Application Security
*Vulnerability Research in Application Security      
*Web Application Penetration Testing
*OWASP Tools and Projects
*Secure Coding Practices
*Technology specific presentations on security such as AJAX, XML, etc.
*Anything else relating to OWASP and Application Security.

The call for papers/presentations is out. The official closing date for receiving a synopsis of the presentation is December 20th, 2008, with announcements on selected candidates to be provided the first week of January 2009. Complete presentations will need to be submitted by the 7th of February 2009.

This year as per last year any presenter will receive an OWASP gift and free invitation to the conference. For some speakers, OWASP will cover some of the travel costs associated with coming to the conference.

Please submit your presentation topics to jderry@owasp.org.
