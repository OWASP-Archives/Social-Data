| short_working_session_description= This will be a "NO FLUFF" track where we pull out ourlaptops (not for email/IM), and show people how to develop securecode. Chris Schmidt referred to this here: http://yet-another-dev.blogspot.com/2010/11/cross-pollination-its-not-just-for-bees.html  The Global Summit in Portugal will be a prototype for this new type of "track" and hopefully we can continue it in Minnesota for AppSec USA 2011. Pravir led something like this with SAMM (but regarding process) in Portugal the first time around and it was incredibly valuable.

| working_session_additional_details = '''Rules of Engagement''' <br>*Facilitator role replaces "speaker". They lead the session, but the session is a working session, laptops open, whiteboards filling. This is not a lecture. <br>
*Other facilitators adopt the present facilitator's goal as their own and we drive the concept/design/code forward Dissenting views are for drinks later. <br>
*Sessions are open to all participants provided they have at least the ability to read the chosen language, and have the following things installed when they arrive:<br>
**Our victim app<br>
**All session dependencies<br>
**Dev tools sufficient to build and run the app and our dependencies<br>
*Facilitators must agree to attend six (6) out of eight (8) sessions. Failing that, they're booted from the next venue<br>
*The objective of each session is split between educating participants and bringing the state of the practice forward.<br>
*Participants may bring whatever code they like, provided they contribute it to OWASP.<br>
*Facilitators should seek to absorb any new developments into the next conference session. IE: each session should have some new and unique content <br>
*Facilitators don't 'own' topics, in fact, I'd like them to rotate between cons. if possible. <br> <br>
'''1. Applying ESAPI Input Validation'''
*Serial Decomp: Decode, canonicalize, filter<br>
*Structured data (SSN, CC, etc.) <br>
*Unstructured data (comments, blogs, etc.) <br>
*Other input exaples (ws-, database, etc.) <br>
'''2. Defining AppSensor Sensors for:'''<br>
*Forced Browsing <br>
*Request Velocity<br>
*Unexpected encodings<br>
*Impersonation (Sudden user switch) <br>
'''3. Managing Sessions'''<br>
*Across requests<br>
*Across containers<br>
*Invalidating sessions (Timeout, attack event, logout)<br>
*Invalidating sessions (across containers, SSO token invalidation, user termination)<br>
'''4. Protecting Information Stored Client-Side'''<br>
*Threat Modeling the problem <br>
*Protecting theft and re-playability of application-specific info (on client & in flight)<br>
*Protecting theft and re-playability of session-specific info (in flight)<br>
*Protecting session-specific information from attack on the client <br>
'''5. Protecting against CSRF - Dan Cornell, Eric Sheridan '''<br>
*Hygiene: Discuss/show frames-busting, cross-domain policy; Discuss referrer and other red herrings <br>
*Tokens (crafting, scoping, and checking)<br>
*Discussions, techniques on scale<br>
*Discussions, techniquest on CAPTCHA, re-auth, etc. <br>
'''6. Providing Access to Persisted Data'''<br>
*Controlling visibility of tables by role<br>
*Providing access to safe SQL-like query through DAO layer<br>
*Discussions, techniques for providing secure'auto-wiring' / marshaling<br>
*Encoding and canonicalization for storage (or alternatively: Security concerns with heirarchical caching and object pooling) <br>

'''7. and 8. TBD'''

There also will be a session to process the "Future" of a "NO FLUFF" OWASP Secure Coding Working Group -- How do we scale this idea and how can we get sponsorship for it?  We hope to schedule at least two more "No Fluff" days for 2011.
