===Meeting Notes second OWASP Belgium Chapter meeting (Leuven, 28-Sep-2005)===
On 28th of September 2005 we had our second OWASP Belgium Chapter meeting. We had nearly 50 people coming to the meeting!<br>

'''WHEN'''<br>
Wednesday 28th of September 2005, 18h00 - 21h00 at Ubizen in Leuven.<br>

'''PROGRAM'''<br>
18h00 - 18h15: Welcome & get a drink <br>

18h15 - 18h45: Sebastien Deleersnyder, Ascure <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''[http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:OWASP_Belgium_Chapter_Meeting_-_Leuven_-_28_Sep_2005_-_1_OWASP_and_OWASP_Membership.ppt  OWASP & OWASP Membership]''' <br>

18h45 - 19h30: Emmanuel Bergmans, I-logs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''[http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:OWASP_Belgium_Chapter_Meeting_-_Leuven_-_28_Sep_2005_-_2_Securing_Web_Applications_with_ModSecurity.ppt Securing Web Applications with ModSecurity]'''<br>
Emmanuel gave an interesting introduction on ModSecurity.<br>
The presentation is included as attachment and contains a lot of great pointers and SWOT analysis.<br>
Conclusions were:<br>
ModSecurity can be particularly useful in an ISP environment<br>
Increased effort is necessary to synchronize multiple ModSecurity configurations in a Webfarm<br>

19h30 - 20h45: <br>
OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities: Panel Discussion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''[http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:OWASP_Belgium_Chapter_Meeting_-_Leuven_-_28_Sep_2005_-_3_OWASP_Top_10_-_Panel.ppt The presentation is included with an introduction of the TOP 10.]'''<br>
Then we had a lively panel Discussion with: <br>
* Erwin Geirnaert, Security Innovation<br>
* Dirk Dussart, Belgian Post<br>
* Eric Devolder, Mastercard<br>
* Herman Stevens, Ubizen<br>
* Frank Piessens, KU Leuven<br>
<br>
We handled questions about the Top 10:<br>
* Is the OWASP Top 10 still necessary?<br>
* Are we talking vulnerabilities, solutions or threats?<br>
* Can we base our best practices / standards on the Top 10?<br>
* How to test your web site security on the Top 10?<br>
* â€¦<br>

The overall discussion was interesting, and at times diverted to an overall application security discussion. <br>
Some of the remarkable opinions covered:<br>
Can / or should the OWASP Top 10 form the basis for a certification scheme<br>
If it is used as an awareness tool, can we promote it with an OWASP magazine?<br>
The OWASP Top 10 is too vague<br>
A bigger exhaustive list is needed with a clear classification and taxonomy<br>
It should be based on threat modelling.<br>
One of the more pertinent questions: how did the original authors come to the Top 10?<br>

===Meeting Notes First OWASP Belgium Chapter Meeting (Gent, 26-May-2005)===

On 26th of May 2005 we held the first OWASP Belgium Chapter meeting!<br>

It was a big success: we had nearly 40 people attending, despite the Belgium-unlike hot weather.<br>


'''PROGRAM'''<br>
17h30 - 18h00: Welcome & get a drink<br>

18h00 - 18h45: Sebastien Deleersnyder, Ascure <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''[http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:First_OWASP_Belgium_Chapter_Meeting_-_Gent_-_26_May_2005_-_I_OWASP_Introduction.ppt OWASP Introduction]'''<br>

19h00 - 19h45: Erwin Geirnaert, Security Innovation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''[http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:First_OWASP_Belgium_Chapter_Meeting_-_Gent_-_26_May_2005_-_II_How_to_Break_Web_Application_Security.ppt How to Break Web Application Security]'''<br>

20h00 - 20h45: professor Frank Piessens, KU Leuven<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''[http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:First_OWASP_Belgium_Chapter_Meeting_-_Gent_-_26_May_2005_-_III_How_to_Build_Secure_Web_Applications.ppt How to Build Secure Web Applications]'''<br>

We had some interesting discussions with Frank on the position of security controls: within the code or within the supporting infrastructure?<br>
Another idea is also to look for a top 10 solutions for Web Applications and have some guidance system when selecting countermeasures.<br>
