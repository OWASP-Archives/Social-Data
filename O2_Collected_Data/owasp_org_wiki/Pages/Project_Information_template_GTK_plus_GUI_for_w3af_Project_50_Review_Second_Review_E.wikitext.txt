I'll agree with Andres that the defined objectives are on schedule.
The following tasks are missing or partially completed:

- Wizard to perform a vulnerability assessment.

- Graphical display of site map and vulnerabilities.

- Users guide for the pyGTK user interface.

- Help system for the GUI itself (help is available in HTML format, but seems to be from previous beta)
