== My organization is not in a position to contribute monetarily, but we would like to contribute technical services. Is there a way for us to be involved?  ==

Technology Supporter designations are available for organizations who make valuable in-kind donations of technology support services. Please contact your local Chapter Leader if you would like to become a Chapter Supporter in this manner or contact the Global Membership Committee if you would like to become an Organizational Supporter.

== I’m an active (chapter leader, project leader, committee member). Does that mean I’m an OWASP Honorary Member and get to vote?  ==

No. During the 2009 election, OWASP Honorary Memberships were granted to all historical chapter leaders, project leaders and committee members, but those honorary memberships have expired.  We ask that you please become an OWASP Individual Member [http://www.regonline.com/owasp_membership Join Here] to support OWASP.  Alternately, you may also request a new OWASP Honorary Membership by submitting the following form [https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&formkey=dHA4dno2TlhSa0pVSUNQclZCOWROV0E6MQ#gid=0 CLICK HERE]  with a description of your recent activities in support of OWASP. We thank you for your ongoing support of OWASP and we require this for being able to track these requests from individuals around the world.

== My organization supports OWASP, but the $5,000 USD as a donation per year to become a Global Supporter is too expensive. What options are available?  ==

A great way to participate in OWASP is to support your local chapter. Please look into becoming a Chapter Supporter at the level where you feel comfortable. This will allow you to support OWASP’s mission and help promote a vibrant application security community in your area. Hopefully in the future you will be in a position to become a global Organizational Supporter. 

== Why Should I Become An OWASP Member or Organization Supporter  ==

OWASP provides documentation, tools, methodologies, standards, articles, and message forums (“OWASP Materials”) as a service to Internet users worldwide to help users and developers understand more about application security. OWASP makes these materials available to end users to help them acquire, build, test, and operate secure software. In addition to the benefits you receive as described above, your membership helps to support the growth of OWASP and the development of new and improved OWASP Materials. Because we are an open, non-commercial entity, we can take on projects that commercial entities driven by profit motives could not. Everyone benefits from these projects. Your support will help OWASP continue to find and fight the causes of insecure software. 

== How Are Funds Used?  ==

OWASP is a 501c3 not-for-profit foundation, and all funds go directly to support OWASP projects, grants, chapters, and infrastructure. Our funds come from conferences, memberships, advertising, and individual and organization supporter contributions.

== Who Must Become an OWASP Member?  ==
