| align="center" style="width:20%; background:#cccccc" | VP&nbsp;of Austin OWASP&nbsp;Chapter
| align="center" style="width:57%; background:#cccccc" | Josh is a hard worker and has led the OWASP&nbsp;Austin chapter for 2010 and 2011. &nbsp;Josh has been an instrumental part of the chapter even before that time and has served in many capacities to make OWASP&nbsp;successful in Austin--from communication to members to arranging food for events to speaking at meetings. &nbsp;I&nbsp;highly recommend Josh and I&nbsp;know that he would make a good addition to the committee. &nbsp;

| align="center" style="width:57%; background:#cccccc" | I've enjoyed working with Josh on each of my multiple occasions visiting the Austin, TX Chapter. It seems like everything Josh touches, is done exquisitely. OWASP would be well served by adding Josh to it's list of global leaders.

| align="center" style="width:57%; background:#cccccc" | Josh has been working with the Austin OWASP Chapter for the past couple of years and has provided immeasurable assistance to the chapter in drumming up membership, getting top-notch presenters, and generally supporting our activities. He is a stand up person and is amongst the smartest security people I know. I think he would be an excellent fit for the OWASP Global Conferences Committee role and he has my highest recommendation for this position.

| align="center" style="width:57%; background:#cccccc" | Josh is extremely enthusiastic, bright and hard working Austin chapter leader. His efforts keep Austin OWASP Chapter constantly thriving and vibrant. He would be awesome for OWASP Global Conferences Committee considering he was instrumental in arranging Austin OWASP LASCON Conference and made it a huge success.
