For his extra-curricular activities after office hours, he took every opportunity to learn about the craft. Now, ten years on, Cecilâ€™s day job is as a director of Grant Thornton LLP in Singapore. As head of the Technology Advisory unit, he leads various engagement teams on diversified projects across vertical industries. His area of focus is in IT Assurance, IT Security Advisory and Digital Forensics. 
Aside from being a committee member of the OWASP GEC, he has also contributed to the OWASP Testing Guide, and coordinated efforts for the internationalisation of Asian languages of OWASP materials. Cecil is also the current Chapter Lead for the Singapore Honeynet Project, ExCo member for the Association of Information Security Professionals (AISP), and a member of the security Controls and Security Services Working Group (Singapore representative body for ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27/WG 4).
