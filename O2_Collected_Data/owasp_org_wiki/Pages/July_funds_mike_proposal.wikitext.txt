'''Why I should be chosen:'''  I have done work on past versions of SiteGenerator and understand the vision of how it is supposed to work.  Also, my past work will help me ramp up quicker and start to contribute more effectively.

'''What I will contribute:''' I will contribute by helping finish up the functionality.  I do not know what the current feature list is but I have contacted Boris so I should know shortly.  I will also help write the documentation, create the installer and do testing so that it is a solid product.  Also, after its release I will do support for the product if anyone has any questions.
