==Description==

This class implements a clone() method but does not implement Cloneable.

It appears that the programmer intended for this class to implement the Cloneable interface because it implements a method named clone(). However, the class does not implement the Cloneable interface and the clone() method will not behave correctly.


==Risk Factors==
TBD

==Examples==

Calling clone() for this class will result in a CloneNotSupportedException.

	public class Kibitzer {
	  public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
		...
