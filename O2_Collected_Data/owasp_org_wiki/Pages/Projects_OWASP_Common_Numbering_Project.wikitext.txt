| project_description = An exciting development, a new numbering scheme that will be common across OWASP Guides and References is being developed. The numbering is loosely based on the OWASP ASVS section and detailed requirement numbering. OWASP ASVS, Guide, and Reference project leads and contributors as well as the OWASP leadership plan to work together to develop numbering that would allow for easy mapping between OWASP Guides and References, and that would allow for a period of transition as Guides and References are updated to reflect the new numbering. This project will provide a centralized clearinghouse for mapping information.
