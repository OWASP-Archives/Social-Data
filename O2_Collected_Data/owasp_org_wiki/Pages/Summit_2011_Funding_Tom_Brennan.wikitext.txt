"We need your help to effect web application security, for just pennies a day you too can save a web application..." *cough* ok... so perhaps this can be your way to say thank you to the volunteerism of others for the OPEN-SOURCE materials you have used for years.  Perhaps you're not able to make it to Portugal yourself, but you want to make sure others will have the opportunity - please help an appsec practitioner.

<!-- END OF PERSONAL REQUEST-->
