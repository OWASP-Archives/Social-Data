The speech will focus on how a Security management framework effects
the life-cycle of a web application and how to put developers and
functional analysts in control of a security risk management
framework. In the first part there will be a quick overview of what a
Security management framework is, best practice on how to deal with it
and the role played in the architectural design phase, the development
phase, the test phase and the enhancement phase. The second part is
more about tools and behaviours that could lead to a set of data that
can be evaluated to fulfill a security risk management in web
application development. The
objective is to demonstrate that security management can be plugged in
in both classical and agile development life-cycle in a unintrusive
manner.
