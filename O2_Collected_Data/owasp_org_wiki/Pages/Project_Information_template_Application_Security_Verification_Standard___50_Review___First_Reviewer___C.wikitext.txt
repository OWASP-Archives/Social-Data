* I’ve been working closely with Mike and the project is on track.  I’m very comfortable with the 50% completion.  This project is a bit complex, and I think we should grant an official extension.  I’d like to get it wrapped up in the next few months, but I’m not sure we’re going to make it in time for the conference.
