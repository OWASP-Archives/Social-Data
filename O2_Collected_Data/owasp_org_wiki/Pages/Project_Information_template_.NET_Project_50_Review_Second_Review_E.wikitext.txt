1. At what extent have the project deliveries & objectives been accomplished?  Having in consideration [[OWASP Summer of Code 2008 Applications#OWASP .NET Project Leader|'''the assumed ones''']], please exemplify writing down those of them that haven't been realised.
 | colspan="2" style="width:75%; background:#cccccc" align="left"| It appears that the project has been successful at creating a useful structure for aggregating data into a single source on the OWASP site.  This in conjunction with the project that is currently being worked on were a team of Microsoft Security MVPs that are writing articles about specific issues should lead toward a strong set of guidelines the community can use.  This in combination with the growing reputaion of the OWASP community should lead to a greater awareness of how to secure DOT NET applications which was another of the goals.

I like the way the project not only relies on OWASP specific document but also links to a number of Microsoft and other resources.  My only suggestion, which may need to come a a later date, would be to address some of the issues around Silverlight which is growing in popularity and is being pushed my Microsoft.  I don't know that this needs to be done as part of this project but it could certanly be done in the future as an extention of the project.
