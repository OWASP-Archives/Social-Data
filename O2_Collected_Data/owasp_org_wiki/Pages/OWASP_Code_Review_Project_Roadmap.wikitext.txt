The project's overall goal is to...

'''be a reference document for the purpose of performing code review. This project shall provide examples in the most common web application development languages (Java and C# .NET)'''

In the near term, we are focused on the following tactical goals...

1. Looking at each attack type and examine the anti-pattern associated with the vulnerability which makes the attack possible. This shall include code examples to guide a reviewer on what to look for.

2. Looking at the code review process, how it is managed and challanges one may encounter when performing code review in the "real world".

3. Looking at the code review tools available and discussing the benefits and issues of using tools.
