At this point the core functionality of the OpenSign project has been developed and tested. This includes the issuing and verifying of certificates within a client server infrastructure. Users must be authenticated and approved by an issuer to use the issuing-service. The issuing is done easily by making use of the client application or online via a web-form. However, OpenSign is not an independent solution for code signing yet. It relies on java-keytool (or an application with the same intention) to generate the client side keys and the certificate sign requests. There is no graphical interface for the client in place. Also the support of .NET code signing was not taken into account yet.
