==Description==

The program violates the Enterprise JavaBeans specification by using the java.io package.

The Enterprise JavaBeans specification requires that every bean provider follow a set of programming guidelines designed to ensure that the bean will be portable and behave consistently in any EJB container [10].

In this case, the program violates the following EJB guideline:

  "An enterprise bean must not use the java.io package to attempt to access files and directories in the file system."

A requirement that the specification justifies in the following way:

  "The file system APIs are not well-suited for business components to access data. Business components should use a 
  resource manager API, such as JDBC, to store data."
