1. At what extent have the project deliveries & objectives been accomplished?  Having in consideration [[OWASP Summer of Code 2008 Applications#Python Static Analysis|'''the assumed ones''']], please exemplify writing down those of them that haven't been realised.

The project is being handled very well. Among all things, it only lacks documentation. Other areas are being developed such as wider language support, more framework.

2. At what extent have the project deliveries & objectives been accomplished?  Having in consideration [[OWASP Summer of Code 2008 Applications#Python Static Analysis|'''the assumed ones''']], please quantify in terms of percentage.

It is more than 50% complete. Overall, I could say it is around 60%. Documentation is probably the weakest link and it earns 5% from me (for a short guide that the author sent me to get me started). Language support is good, around 80%, framework is not so, at 10%, reporting is good at 70% (it has pretty graph though I don't understand it due to lack of documentation), analysis capability is very good but I cannot gauge in terms of percentage.

3. Please do use the right hand side column to provide advice and make work suggestions.

Documentation documentation documentation documentation... At least a user guide is required to get new users try out an example and interpret results. Other than that, probably documents on how to tweak analysis engine are good to have. Other than that, few bugs have been found and reported to the author.
