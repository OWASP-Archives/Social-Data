=== Topic: Security in the Clouds ===

Note: Jon is giving this talk at [http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cloudy_with_a_chance_of_0-day AppsecDC2009] so we'll post his slides after that.

Synopsis:  This talk provides a brief overview of cloud computing, and reveals the security risks of moving into the clouds.  The concept behind cloud computing is simple: use a hosting providerâ€™s IT resources to expand or shrink to meet your needs, and only for pay what you need when you need it.  This architecture appeals to many IT managers as it reduces the initial startup costs, maintenance costs, and overhead required to run systems.  Got slashdotted?  Not a problem.  Your cloud presence will seamlessly expand to push your business to the next level.  However, as with all new technology, there are inherent risks.  We will discuss the security risks with application code, architecture, the runtime environment, and the development environment.
