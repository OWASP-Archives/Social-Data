__NOTOC__There are hundreds of bloggers, journalists, security researchers and hackers, and others who write about application security. And it would be nearly impossible to follow all of this material.

To help with this onslaught of application security news, the OWASP team reviews over 130 of these sources and produces the OWASP '''Moderated''' Application Security News Feed. The OWASP team only selects high-quality posts focused on application security that advance the field, provide useful insight, or are useful educational resources.<!-- Old application security news stories can be found [[Application Security News|here]]. -->
