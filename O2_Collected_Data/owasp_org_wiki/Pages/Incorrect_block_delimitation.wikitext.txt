==Description==

In some languages, forgetting to explicitly delimit a block can result in a logic error that can, in turn, have security implications.

'''Consequences'''

This is a general logic error - with all the potential consequences that this entails.

'''Exposure period'''

* Implementation

'''Platform'''

C, C++, C#, Java

'''Required resources'''

Any

'''Severity'''

Varies

'''Likelihood of exploit'''

Low

In many languages, braces are optional for blocks, and - in a case where braces are omitted - it is possible to insert a logic error where a statement is thought to be in a block but is not. This is a common and well known reliability error.



==Risk Factors==

TBD

==Examples==

In this example, when the condition is true, the intention may be that both ''x'' and ''y'' run.

<pre>
if (condition==true) x;
  y;
</pre>

==Related [[Controls]]==

* Implementation: Always use explicit block delimitation and use static-analysis technologies to enforce this practice.
