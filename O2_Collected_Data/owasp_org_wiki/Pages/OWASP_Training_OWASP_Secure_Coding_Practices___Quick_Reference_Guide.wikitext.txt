| Module_Overview_Goal = This document provides a quick high level reference for secure coding practices. 

It is technology agnostic and defines a set of general software security coding practices, in a checklist format, that can be integrated into the development lifecycle. Implementation of these practices will mitigate most common software vulnerabilities.  


| Content = &nbsp;
The Secure Coding Practices Quick Reference Guide is a technology agnostic set of general software security coding practices, in a comprehensive checklist format, that can be integrated into the development lifecycle. At only 17 pages long, it is easy to read and digest.

The focus is on secure coding requirements, rather then on vulnerabilities and exploits. It is designed to serve as a quick reference or review for the developers, as opposed to being a tool for the security community.

It includes a brief overview of security and risk principles, a glossary of important application security related terminology and links to useful resources.
