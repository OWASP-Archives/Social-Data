'''Assessing and Exploiting Web Applications with the open source Samurai Web Testing Framework''' 

This course will focus on using open source tools to perform web application assessments. The course will take attendees through the process of application assessment using the open source tools included in the Samurai Web Testing Framework Live CD (Samurai-WTF). Day one will take students through the steps and open source tools used to assess applications for vulnerabilities. Day two will focus on the exploitation of web app vulnerabilities, spending half the day on server side attacks and the other half of the day on client side attacks. The latest tools and techniques will be use throughout the course, including several tools developed by the trainers themselves. 

'''Instructor: Justin Searle:''' Justin Searle, a Senior Security Analyst with InGuardians, specializes in penetration testing and security architecture. Previously, Justin served as JetBlue Airway’s IT Security Architect and has provided top-tier support for the largest supercomputers in the world. In his rapidly dwindling spare time, Justin co-leads prominent open source projects including The Middler, Samurai Web Testing Framework, BASE, and the social networking pentest tools: Yokoso! and Laudnum. 

<br> '''Java EE Secure Code Review''' 

The gut of any application lies in its source code. With the ever-emerging landscape of threats and attack vectors facing today’s applications, the need for secure source code has never been greater. In this course, students will be working with actual web application source code samples and discover how to pinpoint weaknesses, identify common security flaws, and discuss corrective coding controls. Major application security domains will be covered, including common authentication and access control coding errors, session management vulnerabilities, identifying injection flaws, and more. For anyone looking to learn how to identify common security weaknesses in a code base, this course is a must. 

'''Instructor: Sahba Kazerooni:''' Sahba Kazerooni is Practice Lead of Software Security Services. He has a strong background in Java EE architecture and development. At Security Compass, Sahba leads the Software Security Services practice which performs penetration testing, source code review, and Threat Modeling of client applications.

Sahba delivers Java secure coding training at the SANS Institute, the largest source for information security training and certification, and has also provided numerous presentations through ISC2 to their elite network of certified information security professionals. 

== 1 Day Training November 10  ==

'''Threat Modeling Express''' The benefits of threat modeling at the design stage are well-documented, yet few organizations are able to perform this analysis technique due to time constraints. Based on our experience in real world situations, Security Compass has developed a one day approach to threat modeling . 

In this class, students learn how to create a “quick and dirty” application threat model using an organization’s most valuable resource: its people. Students learn about the basics of web application security, as well as learn about and perform a real hands-on Express Threat Model. A deliverable template and list of steps will be provided as takeaways for students. 

'''Instructor: Krishna Raja:''' Krishna Raja is an Application Security Consultant with an extensive background in J2EE application development. He has performed comprehensive security assessments for various clients, which involves threat analysis, source code inspection and runtime penetration testing. 

Mr. Raja has also been instrumental in the development and delivery of Security Compass’ training curriculum.

Krishna is an emerging speaker at information security conferences, and last year spoke at Source Boston 2008 and ISSA Secure SD Symposium. 

<br> '''Foundations of Web Services and XML Security''' The movement towards Web Services and Service Oriented architecture (SOA) paradigms requires new security paradigms to deal with new risks posed by these architectures. This session takes a pragmatic approach towards identifying Web Services security risks and selecting and applying countermeasures to the application, code, web servers, databases, application, and identity servers and related software. This course does not require a laptop though a windows based machine is useful for participating in exercises. 

'''Instructor: [[User:Wichers|Dave Wichers]]''', [http://www.aspectsecurity.com Aspect Security]

<br> '''Applying the OWASP Testing Guide with the OWASP Live CD''' 

The OWASP Live CD provides the necessary tools to test web applications. The OWASP Testing Guide provides a testing framework. You're testing web applications currently, now what? Time to take your testing to the next level. This class will offer information on how to use the OWASP Live CD tools together for greater accuracy and speed, how to feed the results of one tool into another, and how to automate the more tedious aspects of web application testing. The training is focused not on what or how to test, but how to get more out of the testing time you have. Lets face it, testing time frames are always shorter then they should be, so how can you squeeze the most into the engagement time you have. After attending this training, you'll have some tricks in your bag to optimize your testing. 

'''Instructor: Matt Tesauro:'''
