DC has been immersed in technology since elementary school. Early experiences with Microsoft Flight Simulator on an 4.77MHz 8086 IBM got him interested in computers as well as aviation. Campbell went on to become a well respected figure in the information security community as well as a FAA certificated pilot.
DC joined Andersen Consulting after graduating from University and his aptitude for hacking quickly led him to the forefront of the Firm's then nascent information security practice. At Andersen, Campbell worked as a security architect for a series of high profile projects while simultaneously providing penetration testing expertise on short engagements all over the world.
Since founding EA Campbell has embraced application security and mobile security and continues to be involved in the community. DC leads the Denver chapter of the Open Web Application Security Project and organizes the successful annual FROC application security conferences.
