== OWASP Netherlands kick-off meeting minutes ==
   	 
On 17 November, OWASP Netherlands had it's first meeting. We moved to a bigger location, the Mercure hotel in Nieuwegein, to host all the 35 attendees.<br/>
<br/>
The agenda:<br/>
18.00 - 18.30 Check-In (bread & drinks)<br/>
18.30 - 18.45 Chapter opening<br/>
18.45 - 19.30 Presentation - 'Top tien web applicatie kwetsbaarheden in J2EE', Eelco Klaver<br/>
19.30 - 19.45 Presentation - 'Veilige webapplicaties boven alles', Mike Wardi<br/>
19.45 - 20.00 Coffee break<br/>
20.00 - 21.00 Discussion - About the OWASP Netherlands local chapter<br/>
<br/>
The discussion took place in a 'round table' session, where all attendees were able to take part. The focus of the discussion was how to give the OWASP Netherlands local chapter additional value, next to the OWASP project. What the goals and tasks will be. And which actions will have to be taken at short term.<br/>
Different people have interest in different subjects. In general meetings there is no time to address all subjects and address them specific enough. Therefore subgroups can be formed, focusing on specific topics. They can have their own communication channel and meetings, but should keep close contact with the OWASP body.<br/>
<br/>
An inventarisation:<br/>
<br/>
Discussion Topics<br/>
- Awareness: writing articles, press publications, interviews<br/>
- Education: contact universities, schools and their common boards. Develop and gather education materials.<br/>
- General: discuss ideas for OWASP NL<br/>
<br/>
Focusgroup Topics<br/>
- (dutch) metrics project<br/>
- (dutch) legal project<br/>
- standard framework for pentest reports<br/>

<br/>
Actions that should be taken on short term are:<br/>
- provide communication channels<br/>
