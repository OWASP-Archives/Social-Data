My concern was with the flow of the language as you move from section to section. This, of course, is a direct byproduct of having different authors for different sections and thier different writing styles.  In a couple of spots it made the guide a little  "disjointed" in it's style and delivery. should this be addressed in a future project or ongoing update?

Likewise, Some authors offered detailed samples of using tools and syntax to test for the vulnerability while others offered general discriptions of how to test.  As we move forward perhaps we could look at standardizing this by maybe adding a detailed sample test that could address each vulnerability.  

Or, another code project moving forward would be to create a test checklist based on the testing guide.  I think it would be of benefit to many, including those new to web application pen testing.

I concur with Nam.  A pdf document and a presentation are still needed.
