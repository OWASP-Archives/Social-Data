== The presentation  ==

[[Image:Michael.j.smith.bluegrey-crop.jpg|right]]Even though IT managers have been pushing towards cloud computing in recent years, people are just now starting to come to grasps with the implications of security in cloud solutions.  There has been much talk about the security of cloud providers but there has been a noticeable absence of vendors willing to come forward and talk about their security program other than "trust us, we have a lot of customers".

This presentation is designed to be a behind-the-scenes look at the security program, products, and features of a typical "clued-in" cloud provider and covers the following:
* The true meaning of DNS--"Does Not Scale" and one--off contract requirements
* How cloud providers approach compliance standards
* Why security certification for vendors is both right and wrong
* How security product management works in a cloud vendor world
* Cloud features that actually help you do your security job: APIs, managment interfaces, and scalability
* Uniquely cloud solutions to uniquely cloud security problems: CloudAudit, FedRAMP, built-in alerting, and more
