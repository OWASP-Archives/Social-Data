==== '''Local News'''  ====


== Latest News ==
So we have hit a bit of a lull over the past two months as you can probably tell. August meeting was really low attendance and September was a non-event since I largely have been out of town and so have a lot of the other co-leads.  Nonetheless, get ready to resume meetings.  Next one is Dec 15th at the Tilted Kilt @ Cumberland.  Make a note and check out details in the Chapter Meetings page above. 

FYI - We are trying to reach out to more developers, quality assurance engineers, and software architects so if you have colleagues in those areas, please invite them to come. For next meeting information, please visit the Chapter Meetings tab and RSVP in the link provided.

== Staying in Touch ==
There is an OWASP Atlanta Linkedin Group. For those addicted to LinkedIn, we have a group you can further feed your addiction. The OWASP Atlanta Chapter. http://www.linkedin.com/groups?home=&amp;gid=1811960&amp;trk=anet_ug_hm

'''ABSTRACT::''' 
In today’s cyber world, it’s no longer a matter of “if” a data breach will occur, but “when.” Organizations around the world, from the local corner store to the global enterprise, all need to understand current data security risks in order to mitigate them.

The Trustwave 2012 Global Security Report identifies the top threats encountered by businesses over the past year. Based on an analysis of Trustwave data sources, including more than 300 incident investigations, 2,000 penetration tests conducted by Trustwave SpiderLabs, and 2 million network and application vulnerability scans, the report provides a roadmap for any organization that needs to improve and update their information security strategy.

The Trustwave 2012 Global Security Report highlights top data security risk areas, offering predictions on future targets based on analysis and perceived trends. By learning from others’ data vulnerabilities, and applying tactical and strategic change outlined in this report, any organization will be better able to reduce data threats and loss.
