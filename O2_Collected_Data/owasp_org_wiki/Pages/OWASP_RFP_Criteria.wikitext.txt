=APPLICATION SECURITY VERIFICATION=

==SUGGESTED INFORMATION TO PROVIDE==

To receive proposals that are comparable it is important to provide clear information to proposing parties about the scope of verification activities.

Information to provide for each application to be subject to verification:

1. Lines of code (Required for verification efforts where source code review will be involved; recommended in all cases in order provide background information about the scale of the application being assessed.  Freely-available software such as CLOC http://cloc.sourceforge.net/ can be used to calculate the number of lines of code.  It is also helpful to provide further information about how the lines of code count was determined â€“ for example a raw count of the lines of code or a count of non-comment source statements)

2. Number of dynamic pages (Some form of this is required for verification efforts where manual penetration testing will be involved.  It is recommended in all cases in order to provide background information about the scale of the application being assessed.  In calculating the number of dynamic pages, it is important to focus on the number of pages with unique functionality.  For example, the URLs /show_product.jsp?id=1 and /show_product.jsp?id=2 likely refer to only one unique dynamic page)

3. List of user roles with role descriptions (Recommended for all verification efforts in order to provide business context for any vulnerabilities identified)

4. Brief description of the application and its architecture.  This is less important for applications with a basic web application architecture (web server, application server, database server...) but more important for applications with non-standard architectures such as those using thick clients, web services or integration with legacy systems.

5. Level of verification desired (Failing to provide guidance on the level of verification desired can result in suppliers providing inconsistent proposals that vary wildly in price):

a) dynamic vulnerability scanning<BR>
b) static analysis<BR>
c) manual penetration testing<BR>
d) manual code review<BR>
e) threat modeling<BR>
f) security architecture review<BR>
g) malicious code analysis<BR>

6. Frequency or duration during which verifications should be performed.  Do you want a single verification or would you like multiple verifications to be performed over a period of time?
