| project_description = 
*The Hackademic Challenges is an open source project that can be used to test and improve one's knowledge of web application security.
*The Hackademic Challenges project implements realistic scenarios with known vulnerabilities in a safe, controllable environment. Users can attempt to discover and exploit these vulnerabilities in order to learn important concepts of information security through the attacker's perspective.
*They have been especially designed for use in a classroom environment where they have been proved a valuable educational tool. Using hackademic challenges students have the chance to experience application security in a realistic environment, something that triggers their interest and provokes a lot of interesting discussions.
*The Hackademic Challenges are currently used in several Universities and have received very positive feedback from both professors and students.
