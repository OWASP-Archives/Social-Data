{{:Projects/OWASP ASIDE Project | Project About}}

==== Take a Look ====

ASIDE is still under development. But in order to give you a sense of what it should be doing, we have this old version of [http://webpages.uncc.edu/~jxie2/aside_old.swf ASIDE DEMO]. You will need Adobe Flash to display it. A newer version will soon be uploaded.

==== Download ====

The first publicly available ASIDE can be downloaded [http://webpages.uncc.edu/~jxie2/edu.uncc.sis.aside_0.0.1.jar here]. You also need to download the complementary [http://webpages.uncc.edu/~jxie2/edu.uncc.sis.aside.logging_0.0.1.jar logging] facility to make ASIDE work properly. ASIDE is built upon [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/indigosr1 Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers] Version 3.5+.

To make it work, please place the two jar files under the plugins folder of your Eclipse installation directory and then restart your Eclipse.
