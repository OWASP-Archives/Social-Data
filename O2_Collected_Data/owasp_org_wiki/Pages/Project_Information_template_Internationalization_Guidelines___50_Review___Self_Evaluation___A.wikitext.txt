3. What kind of help is required either from the Reviewers or from the OWASP Community?
 | colspan="2" style="width:75%; background:#cccccc" align="left"|
We need Larry to help us make the changes in OWASP.org site so we can start uploading content and make it available for reviewers in the live instance.<br />
From the reviewers to start reviewering the content but this is expected to happen in the following days as it become available. Although only 2 issues are missing.
