[[File:Banner-securitysafety-2.png]]

This session has two aspects - safety critical systems, and safety in regards to protection of vulnerable groups (e.g. children).

* What can OWASP learn from software safety engineering?
* What can OWASP contribute to software safety engineering?
* How does OWASP's work tie in to wider concerns about internet safety?

Get your helmets (hard hats) on and come along to discuss whether we need a new OWASP project, a new OWASP guide or embed safety thinking throughout OWASP's work.

This session will be particularly relevant to those interested in process control, safety critical applications, critical national infrastructure and other applications that could have a direct impact on system & human safety.

Safety is not only concerned with confidentiality, integrity and availability. A safety-critical system (or life-critical system) is one where failure or malfunction can lead to ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-critical_system Wikipedia]):
* death or serious injury to people, or
* loss or severe damage to equipment or
* environmental harm.
In languages other than English, the distinction between "safety" and "security" may be less clear.  [http://www.dailywritingtips.com/safety-and-security/ Here] is a good description of their slightly different meanings in English.

With software being used in so many safety-critical systems, the impact of application security flaws can have critical impacts on humans, equipment and the environment.  There have been great advances in safety system design, but control system security is less advanced ([http://www.controlglobal.com/articles/2010/SafetySecurity1004.html Byres & Cusimano]).

This session will discuss whether and how OWASP should contribute to the efforts in system safety.
