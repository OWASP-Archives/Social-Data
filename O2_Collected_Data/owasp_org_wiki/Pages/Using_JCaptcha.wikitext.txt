=== Overview ===
Captcha stands for "'''C'''ompletely '''A'''utomated '''P'''ublic '''T'''uring test to tell '''C'''omputers and '''H'''umans '''A'''part". A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha captcha] typically takes the form of an image containing distorted letters and/or numbers and is often used on web sites where it is important to determine whether the user is a real person or a computer program.  Captcha's have some drawbacks such as accessibility for the visually impaired, high CPU requirements, and possible circumvention techniques.  In many cases, however, Captcha's can help mitigate certain types of attacks launched by malicious individuals using automated tools.  At a minimum they can raise the bar enough to deter a casual attacker.
