= OWASP Honorary Member/Leader Process =

== Overview  ==

*Annual Self Nomination Process- rolling basis per individuals expiration<br>
*State work contributed to OWASP as justification for honorary status 
*Submissions evaluated and decided by Global Membership Committee - intent is to liberally award those that are actively contributing to OWASP

== Why This Approach ==
* Decentralized - This requires the individual to self evaluate and present their justification. This is much more scalable than a central group trying to identify all leaders. A group can then manage the number of submitted justifications.
* Individually Driven - No worry of forgetting someone since people nominate themselves. If they aren't aware of the new process, then they probably aren't that active in the organization (provided we appropriately advertise / discuss)
* Keeps People Accountable - Can't just grab a chapter lead/ committee / board spot and sit on it. We'll reward those that are contributing.

== Example Justification Questions ==
'''Chapter Leaders'''
* How many chapter meetings have you organized in the past year?
* What has been the total turn out at these meetings?

'''Project Leaders'''
* What significant contributions have you made to your project in the last year?
* Has the project reached a major milestone?
* Has the project been featured in any blogposts, conferences, magazines, etc?

'''Global Committee Members'''
* What percentage of the meetings have you attended for your committee?
* What contributions have you made to the committee?

'''Board Members'''
* What percentage of the board meetings have you attended?
* What initiatives have you led for OWASP in the past year?

'''For All'''
* Are there any other ways you have been helping advance OWASP?
* Anything else we missed?

= Voting Rights =
* This concept needs to be clearly defined, documented on the website, and linked to from the [[Membership]] page.
** Does it simply mean voting on [[About_OWASP#Global_Board_Members|Board]] members?
*** This means voting on all official ballots OWASP votes. To date this has just included the board vote. There is another board vote in 2011 and may be other OWASP votes on other topics in the future.
** Why isn't this "right" explained or even mentioned at all on the [[Membership]] page?
*** This is in progress and will be added on the Membeship page once we formally roll this new initiative out.
** Do "Honorary" Members get to vote?
*** Yes, see above. It says "yes" in the vote column for Honorary Members.
** When and how does voting take place?
*** We should create a wiki page with more info on voting. TBD
