==Description==

The program violates the Enterprise JavaBeans specification by listening on a socket or accept connections on a socket.
However it can act as a network socket client.

The Enterprise JavaBeans specification requires that every bean provider follow a set of programming guidelines designed to ensure that the bean will be portable and behave consistently in any EJB container [1].

In this case, the program violates the following EJB guideline:

  "An enterprise bean must not attempt to listen on a socket, accept connections on a socket, or use a socket for multicast."

A requirement that the specification justifies in the following way:

  "The EJB architecture allows an enterprise bean instance to be a network socket client, but it does not allow it to be 
  a network server. Allowing the instance to become a network server would conflict with the basic function of the 
  enterprise bean â€“ to serve the EJB clients."
