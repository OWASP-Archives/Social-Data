==Questions==
*  How did your team come up with the idea of writing this paper?
*  How does the security analysis of Core J2EE patterns differ from the Core Security patterns book? Do we need both?
*  Why did you choose the J2EE Core Design patterns and not the Gang of Four Design Patterns?
*  What value does this analysis have? Who is actually going to use this stuff?
*  How does this design pattern analysis differ from the most popular design-time security activity: threat modeling?
*  The analysis doesn’t have a notion of “risk” –  it doesn’t articulate the difference between say an application on Intranet versus one on the Internet.  
*  What are the next steps for this OWASP project?
*  How can people contribute to the project?
