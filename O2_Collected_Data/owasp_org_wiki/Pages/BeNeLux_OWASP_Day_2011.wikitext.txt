'''OWASP Training: Secure Application Development, by Eoin Keary'''

'''Abstract:''' Writing Secure code is the most effective method to securing your web applications. Writing secure code takes skill and know-how but results in a more stable and robust application and assists in protecting an organisations brand.
Application security is not commonly a part of many computer science curricula today and most organizations have not focused on instituting a culture that includes application security as a core part of their software development training efforts. This intensive one-day course focuses on the most common web application security problems, including aspects of both the OWASP Top Ten (2010) and the MITRE Top 25.  The course will introduce and demonstrate application assessment techniques, illustrating how application vulnerabilities can be exploited so students really understand how to avoid introducing such vulnerabilities in their code.

'''This course includes coverage of the following areas:'''

* Unvalidated Input
* Injection Flaws, OS commanding, SQL Injection
* Cross-Site Scriping & Client-side security
* CSRF/XSRF
* Authentication & Session Management
* Access control & Authorisation
* Broken Caching
* Error Handling & Resource Management
* The Secure SDLC
* Fuzzing, Proxy use and testing approach

'''Hands on Exercises'''

To cement the principles discussed, students can participate in a number of hands-on security testing exercises where they attack a live web application (i.e., OWASP Bank etc) that has been seeded with common web application vulnerabilities.

The students will use proxy tools commonly used by the hacker community to complete the exercises. Students need to bring their own windows based laptop to participate in the exercises. Wireless capability is recommended.  '''Make sure to get a copy of BURP proxy prior to the training: [http://www.portswigger.net/burp/downloadfree.html http://www.portswigger.net/burp/downloadfree.html]'''

'''Audience'''

Developers who want to understand the most common web application security flaws, and how to avoid them and code in a secure manner.

Level: Beginner/Intermediate

Prerequisite: Basic knowledge of a web programming language like Java or .NET recommended but not required.

Bringing your own windows based laptop is recommended so you can participate in the hands on exercises

===== Extra session on Security testing: a key challenge for software engineering of web apps (17h00 - 18h00)===== 
While important efforts are dedicated to system functional testing, very few works study how to specifically and systematically test security mechanisms. In this talk, we will present two categories of approaches. 
The first ones aim at assessing security mechanisms compliance with declared policies. Any security policy is strongly connected to system functionality: testing function includes exercising many security mechanisms. However, testing functionality does not intend at exercizing all security mechanisms. We thus propose test selection criteria to produce tests from a security policy. Empirical results will be presented about access control policies and about Android apps permission checks.  
 
The second ones concern the attack surface of web apps, with a particular focus on web browser sensitivity to XSS attacks. Indeed, one of the major threats against web applications is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) that crosses several web components: web server, security components and finally the client’s web browser. The final target is thus the client running a particular web browser. During this last decade, several competing web browsers (IE, Netscape, Chrome, Firefox) have been upgraded to add new features for the final users benefit. However, the improvement of web browsers is not related with systematic security regression testing. Beginning with an analysis of their current exposure degree to XSS, we extend the empirical study to a decade of most popular web browser versions.The results reveal a chaotic behavior in the evolution of most web browsers attack surface over time. This particularly shows an urgent need for regression testing strategies to ensure that security is not sacrificed when a new version is delivered. 
 
In both cases, security must become a specific target for testing in order to get a satisfying level of confidence in security mechanisms

===== From DigiNotar to Leaktober=====
Web application security is hard. With Lektober, Brenno shows that to the general public. Privacy is at stake, not only in the Netherlands. Brenno will reveal some of the more "interesting" leaks.

=====Brenno J.S.A.A.F. de Winter=====
Brenno De Winter started experimenting with security at the age of 9. He has a background in open source that dates back to 1993 and he contributed to several projects like MySQL, GnuPG, Gnucomo (Gnu Computer Monitoring) and recently started the Small Sister-project for privacy-friendly internet usage. In his daily job he practices security,teaches it and works as an IT-journalist. His writings have triggered several debates in parliament and often raises questions. 

=====OWASP SIMBA - guarding your applications (by [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/BeNeLux_OWASP_Day_2011#Koen_Vanderloock.2C_Leader_Security_Competence_Group_at_Cegeka Koen Vanderloock], Leader Security Competence Group at Cegeka)=====
[[OWASP SIMBA Project|SIMBA (Security Integration Module for Business Applications)]] is a OWASP project that provides you with a User Access Management system that can be integrated with any business application. The purpose of SIMBA is to secure an application fast and easy. Because SIMBA itself is generic it can be customized for every project. Many features are customizable e.g. designing your own authentication chain is easy and fast by using existing or newly created building blocks. SIMBA contains authentication, authorization, session management and a GUI to manage your security information.

======Koen Vanderloock, Leader Security Competence Group at Cegeka======
Koen Vanderloock is the leader of the security competence group at Cegeka.   About  2 years ago Cegeka decided to create a sandbox for investigating security issues and solutions so they could be included in the current projects.

=====Practical Crypto Attacks Against Web Applications (by [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/BeNeLux_OWASP_Day_2011#Justin_Clarke.2C_Director_and_Co-Founder_of_Gotham_Digital_Science_Ltd Justin Clarke], Director and Co-Founder of Gotham Digital Science Ltd)=====
The science of cryptography underpins many of the information security technologies we use on a daily basis, such as the ability to keep information confidential and to ensure we can identify who we are communicating with. However, it is a very complex subject area with many types of mistakes that can reduce the overall security of a solution. A number of these types of mistakes can be identified by a tester, if they know what they're looking for, but in general it isn't a well tested area.
 
This talk is intended to provide a high level overview of some of the areas where cryptographic operations such as encryption and hashing can provide far less security than was planned, and concrete examples of how these were found and exploited. Examples will include discussion and demonstration of the recently patched cryptographic padding attack against the Microsoft .NET framework (affecting ASP.NET applications) caused by a design error in how ASP.NET handles some types of encrypted data, but we will also be looking at some other fun areas including bit flipping attacks, ECB mode attacks, and some miscellaneous hashing algorithm attacks against common web application implementations.

=====HTML5 security (by [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/BeNeLux_OWASP_Day_2011#Lieven_Desmet.2C_Research_Manager_at_Katholieke_Universiteit_Leuven Lieven Desmet], Research Manager at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven)=====
In this talk, Lieven will highlight the results of the HTML5 security analysis, conducted by the DistriNet Research Group (K.U.Leuven). The security analysis of next generation web standards, commissioned by ENISA, looked into 13 emerging W3C web standards (i.e. the specification of HTML 5 and some of the associated APIs), and assessed the security of each of them as well as the overall security and consistency across specifications.

In total 51 security threats and issues have been identified, and detailed in the ENISA report (http://www.enisa.europa.eu/html5). During the talk, Lieven will discuss the methodology developed to assess the huge amount of specifications, and zoom into a representative set of identified threats and their remediation.

=====Overcoming iOS Data Protection to Re-Enable iPhone Forensics (by [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/BeNeLux_OWASP_Day_2011#Andrey_Belenko.2C_Chief_Security_Researcher_at_ElcomSoft Andrey Belenko], Chief Security Researcher at ElcomSoft)=====
Data protection is a feature available for iOS devices (iOS 4 and up) with hardware encryption: iPhone 4S, iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, iPod touch (3rd generation or later), and all iPad models. Introduction of this feature had complicated iPhone forensics process because now (almost) all files on user partition are encrypted and physical dumps are of much less value to examiners: while the filesystem seems to be intact, actual file contents are encrypted and are not suitable for analysis.

This talk will provide in-depth information about iOS Data protection internals and on the implication it had on iOS forensics. More specifically, it will cover the following:
*System keys and their hierarchy
*Device passcode and its recovery
*Escrow keys
*Filesystem encryption
*Keychain encryption

Presentation will start by providing attendees with required background on iOS encryption keys architecture: system keys, passcode key, escrow key. After attendees are familiar with those concepts, presentation will continue to filesystem and keychain encryption details and to the techniques that can be used to overcome the hurdles imposed by iOS Data Protection.

=====Do you... Legal? (by [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/BeNeLux_OWASP_Day_2011#Ludovic_Petit.2C_Group_Fraud_.26_Information_Security_Adviser_at_SFR.2C_Vodafone_Group Ludovic Petit], Group Fraud & Information Security Adviser at SFR, Vodafone Group) =====

The OWASP core mission is to make application security visible, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about true application security risks. However, if you do not pay enough attention to many aspects of Legal compliance, you'll see why Web Application Security is somehow linked to Legal and Regulatory aspects as well as... Corporate Responsability, so yours. Who is accountable for what, what about each other's responsibility? Nowadays, the legal constraints oblige us to comply via technical means, whatever the local framework, and this is specially true for Web Application Security, many sensitive informations having to be handled through these web interfaces. A such, what do you think about your Security Policy compliance with your local Legal framework? Compliant? Sure? Really? Interesting isn't it? Let's have a talk about this.

======Ludovic Petit, Group Fraud & Information Security Adviser at SFR, Vodafone Group======

=====Dynamic malware analysis - or: The ~five  deadly (anti-)venoms (by Sascha Rommelfangen, Incident Management - Security Research at CIRCL) =====
Malware reversing is a time consuming task. Many approaches are available to dissect and analyse suspicious binaries. Dynamic malware analysis is one of the option to better understand them and also a nifty companion to static analysis.  The current dynamic malware analysis techniques will be presented especially the ones relying on instrumented operating system systems (from the filesystem to the network stack).  You'll see a wandering through common and less common malware partially analysed using dynamic analysis and how dynamic malware analysis can help you.

===== The limits of e-banking (by Jean-Marc Bost and Sébastien Bischof, ECLA)  =====
The swiss german TV channel SF1 showed a footage on swiss e-banking security. The TV show follows a team of the ETH who earned a special authorization to test several e-anking platforms. After admitting that a personal computer can be infected by different means (actually 5% of the tested PCs are infected according to Microsoft), The team from Zürich showed the limits of the different platforms. Only the bank who signs each transaction is labelled as safe. We will come back during the presentation on the nature of the threat.<br>First of all, we will explain how famous malwares such as Zeus and SpyEye manage to steal from their victims without them being able to notice anything. Then we will see that e-banking is not the only target, as a matter of fact, the reality is far from this.<br>And then we will comment the most recent techniques that allow malwares to escape Antivirus and Antimalware programs even if they are up to date. We will vulgarize several concepts such as DKOM and bootkits in order to let everybody have a glimpse on the danger they represent.<br>Finally, we will think about if signing each transaction can efficiently fight off these threats. In fact, when attacks are coupled with Social Engineering, they have potentially no limit. Zeus is a living proof of this fact, because it even managed to attack the transaction validation system by SMS. As a conclusion, we will see that the e-banking platform that managed to resist the tests of the ETH team is vulnerable to such kind of attacks.

This intensive one-day training focuses on the most common web application security problems, including aspects of both the OWASP Top Ten (2010) and the MITRE Top 25. The training will introduce and demonstrate application assessment techniques, illustrating how application vulnerabilities can be exploited so students really understand how to avoid introducing such vulnerabilities in their code.
