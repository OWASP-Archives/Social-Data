The OWASP Application Security Skills Assessment (OWASP ASSA) is an online multiple-choice quiz built to help individuals understand their strengths and weaknesses in specific application security skills with the aim of enabling them to focus their training in the most efficient and appropriate manner.

Upon completion of the quiz, for each question, it will tell the quiz taker whether they had the correct or incorrect answer, a discussion of the question, the specific application security areas the question focused on, a discussion about the correct an incorrect answers, and links to further references.
