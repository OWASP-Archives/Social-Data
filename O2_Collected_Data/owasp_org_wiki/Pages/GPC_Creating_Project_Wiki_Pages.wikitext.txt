Steps to starting a project (paraphrased from ''draft'' [http://sl.owasp.org/gpcws-jun11-projects-handbook#h.tao6g9hw1lup Project Handbook]:
# Submitter sends request via: [http://sl.owasp.org/new-project new project request form]
# Request generates an email to the GPC containing project submission
# ''All'' requests are held for a seven day waiting period ("speedbump") for committee and community review/feedback.
# At the conclusion of the "speedbump" period, the project is created.

Steps to creating a project on the OWASP Wiki:
# Determine Project Name
# Create OWASP mailing list
# Create main project page (/[project_name])
# Create Project Roadmap Page (/Projects/[project_name]/Roadmap)
# Create Project Metadata wiki page (/Projects/[project_name])
# Create Project Releases wiki page (/Projects/[project_name]/Releases)
# Add to Project Inventory Spreadsheet
