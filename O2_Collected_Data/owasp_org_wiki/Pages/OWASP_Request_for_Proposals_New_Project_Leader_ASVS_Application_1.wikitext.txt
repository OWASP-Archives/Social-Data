| Proposed_Roadmap_Text = I'm one of the original coauthors of ASVS, along with Jeff Williams and Mike Boberski. As to the future of ASVS, I'd like to update the ASVS periodically (every 2 or 3 years, similar to what we are doing with the Top 10), and help align OWASP's Guide Projects with ASVS. I haven't thought about this really hard, so I'm very interested in coleadership with others who have passion and energy to contribute to this important OWASP project.
