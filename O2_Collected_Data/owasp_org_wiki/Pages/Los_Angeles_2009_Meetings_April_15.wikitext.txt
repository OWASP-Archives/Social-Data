== Abstract: Cross Site Scripting, Exploits and Defenses==

For a long time, the impact of XSS vulnerabilities has been grossly underestimated. Recent compromises, such as the pro-Hillary [http://cyberinsecure.com/hacked-obama-site-redirects-visitors-to-clintons-site/ defacement] of Barack Obama's website, and a [http://www.securescience.net/twoubledtwitter.html Viral XSS in Twitter] demonstrated the impact of XSS vulnerabilities to the masses.

During this presentation, David Campbell will demonstrate exactly how effective XSS vulns can be, and show you what you can do to protect yourself and your sites.

This presentation was originally delivered to OWASP Colorado in May of 2008, and has been updated for this session.
