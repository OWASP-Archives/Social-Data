Welcome to the Irish OWASP Application Security Conference!<br> 

On&nbsp;'''September 17th, 2010''' OWASP held its second Irish Application Security conference in&nbsp;Dublin University, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland.

==== About  ====

The conference consisted of an intensive day of talks/presentations and discussion with 2 different tracks focusing on the causes and trends in web application insecurity. <br>

Finally six months of work by the OWASP Ireland chapter board paid off:<br>

Many thanks :<br>
- To every one who attended, helped out, presented, ran about.<br>
- To Samy Kamkar who came over to enlighten us all about how he'll meet your girlfriend.......<br>
- To John Viega, Fred Piper and Damian Gordon for their keynotes, they were great and provoked much discussion.<br>
- To all our local and international speakers who took time (and expense) to come over and present...<br>
- Also thanks to our sponsors for all assistance.<br>

==== Training  ====

We intend to hold some application security training on the 16/09/2010 the day prior to the event.<br>This can be booked when booking a ticket to the event.<br> 

== '''Secure Application Development: Writing secure code (and testing it)'''<br>  ==

'''Trainers''': 

[[User:EoinKeary|'''Eoin Keary'''&nbsp;]] Senior Manager, Ernst &amp; Young, OWASP Board Member 

'''Rahim Jina''' Senior Consultant, Ernst &amp;&nbsp;Young, OWASP Ireland chapter board. 

<br> 

'''Abstract'''<br>Writing Secure code is the most effective method to securing your web applications. Writing secure code takes skill and know-how but results in a more stable and robust application and assists in protecting an organisations brand. 

Application security is not commonly a part of many computer science curricula today and most organizations have not focused on instituting a culture that includes application security as a core part of their software development training efforts. This intensive one-day course focuses on the most common web application security problems, including aspects of both the OWASP Top Ten (2010) and the MITRE Top 25.&nbsp; The course will introduce and demonstrate application assessment techniques, illustrating how application vulnerabilities can be exploited so students really understand how to avoid introducing such vulnerabilities in their code. 

This course includes coverage of the following areas: 

*Unvalidated Input 
*Injection Flaws 
*Cross-Site Scriping 
*CSRF 
*Authentication &amp;&nbsp;Session Management 
*Access control &amp; Authorisation 
*Broken Caching 
*Error Handling &amp;Resource Management 
*Cryptography 
*Rich Internet Applications 
*The Secure SDLC

<br>'''Hands on''' 

To cement the principles discussed, students can participate in a number of hands-on security testing exercises where they attack a live web application (i.e., WebGoat etc) that has been seeded with common web application vulnerabilities. The students will use proxy tools commonly used by the hacker community to complete the exercises. Students need to bring their own windows based laptop to participate in the exercises. 

'''Audience''' 

Developers who want to understand the most common web application security flaws, and how to avoid them and code in a secure manner 

'''Level''' 

Intermediate 

'''Prerequisite''' 

Basic knowledge of a web programming language like Java or .NET recommended but not required. <br> 

Bringing your own windows based laptop is recommended so you can participate in the hands on exercises. 

'''Duration''' 

Full day - 8 Hours<br>
