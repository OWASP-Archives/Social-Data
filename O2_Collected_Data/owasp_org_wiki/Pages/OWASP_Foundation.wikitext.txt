==The OWASP Foundation==
The OWASP Foundation was established on April 21, 2004 as a not-for-profit charitable organization in the United States to ensure the ongoing availability and support for our work at [[Main Page|OWASP]]. OWASP is an international organization and the OWASP Foundation supports OWASP efforts around the world.

==Tax Status: 501(c)(3) Not-For-Profit Organization==
The OWASP Foundation is a U.S. recognized [http://www.irs.gov/charities/charitable/article/0,,id=96114,00.html 501(c)(3)] not-for-profit charitable organization. The OWASP Foundation received its formal recognition by the U.S. government of its 501(c)(3) status on December 10, 2004. This not-for-proft status allows contributors to deduct any ''donations'' made to the OWASP Foundation.

OWASP's U.S. Employer Identification Number (EIN) is: 20-0963503.

==Tax Deductability of Payments to OWASP==
OWASP membership fees, OWASP conferences fees, OWASP conference sponsorships, and OWASP banner ads are ''not'' considered tax-deductible donations due to the benefits the paying organization/individual receives.

Direct donations to OWASP are fully tax-deductible given OWASP's recognized U.S. not-for-profit status.

==Membership or Donations==
