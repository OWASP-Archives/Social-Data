* Meeting started 5PM/GMT 
* Chapter survey (Matt/Seba) - do we have a questionnaire tool (google doc form / survey monkey)? anonymous or named (latter preferred)?
** Only forty active chapters / inactive chapter contacts?

** try to have the survey ready (drafted) by Nov 11
** ALL: shoot an e-mail to Matt with question ideas
* Chapter handbook (Ofer)
** New version online - mail to leaders list (Ofer)
* Proxy voting mechanism for chapters with no chapter leader present?
** vote per chapter board member / chapter leader /or one vote per chapter? For 2009: one vote per chapter. Proxy: per e-mail (with confirmation - to prevent spoofing) prior Nov 10 (starting on day when all candidates are known). One vote per chapter leader. (seba to contact Dan who's working on the voting process)
* DC summit: 
** chapter handbook
** survey results
** goals: revive inactive meetings (new active chapter leaders + provide guidance) - grow # active chapters (at least 2 meetings per year) + put 'scoring' system on that.
* Call for mentors (Seba)
* Chapter governance (extended version of the rules) = Life cycle = cookbook chapter (Ofer)
* Handling money (Seba to add stuff to the handbook)
* Chapter success criteria: organize meetings / getting people actively involved in OWASP (I18N, translations...)
