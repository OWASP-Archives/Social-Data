==Starting a Chapter==

You don't need to be an expert in application security, just motivated to help build the OWASP community and organize meetings. There's a lot of help available from other Local Chapter leaders. So get your community moving to help the mission of software security awareness and start a local OWASP Chapter today!

'''A request to start or restart a chapter should be submitted by the founding member or group to the [http://sl.owasp.org/contactus OWASP Contact Us]''' and should include:

# List of the people that are founding the chapter and the geographical area to be covered by the new chapter, 
# Brief description of professional background or resume (from each of the founding leaders),
# Statement of why he or she wants to be an OWASP Leader (from each of the founding leaders).
# Each founding leader(s) (as well as any leaders joining the chapter after its creation) must read, understand, and agree to the terms of the [[Chapter Leader Handbook]].

 Generally speaking, the Chapter Leader Handbook asks that you:
 * Will commit to organizing at least quarterly meetings
 * Will find a stable location for meetings
 * Will find great speakers
 * Will publicize the chapter and recruit new members
 * Will keep the chapter non-commercial


'''What is the process once I submit my request to start a chapter?'''

Once submitted, [http://sl.owasp.org/contactus the request] will be reviewed and approved by the Global Chapters Committee.   Once the new chapter is approved

1.  A chapter wiki page and mailing list will be set up for the new leader(s). 

2.  The chapter leader(s) will be given an owasp email account and password to operate as the administrator of the new chapter mailing list.

==Bring Speakers to Your Chapter==
To support Local Chapter meetings and (web application) security conferences we started a travel-support program for OWASP presenters. If you are interested in attracting an OWASP speaker to your event, have a look at [[OWASP on the Move]]!
