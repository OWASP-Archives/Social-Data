==OWASP Newsletter #4 (31-Jan-07)==

Welcome to OWASP Newsletter #4

; '''[[Top 10 2007|OWASP Top 10 2007 RC1]]'''
: As mentioned last week, we finally got the new version RC1 (Release Candidate 1) of the OWASP Top 10 out for review, criticism and comment. We take all comments very seriously (see[http://sylvanvonstuppe.blogspot.com/2007/01/owasp-top-10-2007-update-rc1.html Sylvan von Stuppe], so please do spend the time to check this version and speak up your mind.

; '''[[OWASP WebGoat Project|WebGoat]]'''
: See below for a feature on one of our longest and most famous projects, which has released WebGoat 5.0 RC1  containing a bunch of new lessons created via an [[Owasp_Autumn_Of_Code_2006|OWASP Autumn of Code]] sponsorship.

; '''OWASP Grants'''
: Talking about the AoC (Autumn of Code), if all goes well we will close it officially next week, and will announce the SpoC. SpoC has you must be guessing by now, is the OWASP Spring of Code (still with no connection with Google's Summer of Code) :) 

; '''Support for Non-Profits'''
: As you can see on the updated pages section, we also made a small change in our membership criteria, where we changed the 'Educational Members' category to be 'Educational and Non-Profit Members'.

; '''RSA Meetup'''
: If you are going to the RSA conference next week, drop a line to Brian Bertacini from the San Jose OWASP Chapter for details on an OWASP get-together.

== Featured Project: WebGoat 5.0 RC1 ==
'''WebGoat Overview'''

[[:Category:OWASP WebGoat Project|WebGoat]] is a deliberately insecure J2EE web application maintained by OWASP designed to teach web application security lessons. In each lesson, users must demonstrate their understanding of a security issue by exploiting a real vulnerability in the WebGoat application. For example, in one of the lessons the user must use SQL injection to steal fake credit card numbers. The application is a realistic teaching environment, providing users with hints and code to further explain the lesson.

To get started, read the [http://www.owasp.org/index.php/WebGoat_User_and_Install_Guide_Table_of_Contents|WebGoat User and Install Guide]


'''WebGoat 5.0 Release Candidate 1'''

Thursday January 17th, WebGoat 5.0 Release Candidate 1 was released. Special thanks to the many people who have sent comments and suggestions and those who have put in the effort to contribute their time to this release.

The 5.0 release would not have been possible without the efforts of Sherif Koussa and [[Owasp_Autumn_Of_Code_2006|OWASP Autumn of Code 2006]].

This version can be downloaded from OWASP's Sourceforce repository: [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64424&package_id=61824 WebGoat 5.0 RC1]

Please send all comments to webgoat AT g2-inc DOT com regarding this release candidate. 

== Featured Item: OWASP Documentation Projects ==

I wrote this on an email the other day, and realized that it was a good list of our best documentation projects: 

* [[:Category:OWASP Top Ten Project|OWASP Top Ten Project]] "The OWASP Top Ten provides a powerful awareness document for web application security. The OWASP Top Ten represents a broad consensus about what the most critical web application security flaws are. Project members include a variety of security experts from around the world who have shared their expertise to produce this list"
* [[:Category:OWASP Guide Project|OWASP Guide Project]] "The Guide is aimed at architects, developers, consultants and auditors and is a comprehensive manual for designing, developing and deploying secure web applications."
* [[:Category:OWASP AppSec FAQ Project|OWASP AppSec FAQ Project]] "This FAQ answers some of the questions that developers have about Web Application Security. This FAQ is not specific to a particular platform or language. It addresses the common threats to web applications and are applicable to any platform."
* [[:Category:OWASP Testing Project|OWASP Testing Guide]] "This project's goal is to create a "best practices" penetration testing framework which users can implement in their own organizations and a "low level" penetration testing guide that describes how to find certain issues."
* [[:Category:OWASP CLASP Project|OWASP CLASP Project]] "CLASP (Comprehensive, Lightweight Application Security Process) provides a well-organized and structured approach for moving security concerns into the early stages of the software development lifecycle, whenever possible."
* [[:Category:OWASP Honeycomb Project|OWASP Honeycomb Project]] "In the Honeycomb project, OWASP is assembling the most comprehensive and integrated guide ever attempted to the fundamental building blocks of application security (principles, threats, attacks, vulnerabilities, and countermeasures) through collaborative community efforts."
* [[:Category:OWASP Application Security Assessment Standards Project|OWASP Application Security Assessment Standards Project]] "Currently there is a lack of standardization over what constitutes an application security assessment. With no single set of criteria being referenced, it is suggested that OWASP establish a set of standards defining and establishing a baseline approach to conducting differing types/levels of application security assessment. The standards should be flexible in design to accommodate a range of security assurance levels. The standards should not be viewed as placing requirements on any party. Rather, the standards should make recommendations about what should be done to be consistent with what the OWASP community believes is best practice. Adhering to the standards should help increase end user organization confidence that assessments meet an industry agreed-upon approach.?"
* [[:Category:OWASP Application Security Metrics Project|OWASP Application Security Metrics Project]] "This OWASP Project will first identify and provide the OWASP community a set of application security metrics that have been found by contributors to be effective in measuring application security. This will be followed by the development of new metrics that build on the initial metrics foundation to fulfill unmet metrics requirements. The goals of this Project are to make a baseline set of application security metrics available to the OWASP community and subsequently to provide a forum for the community to contribute metrics back into the baseline."

== OWASP References in the Media ==

This week we have two examples of non compliance with the [[OWASP brand usage rules]], namely the #''8. The OWASP Brand must not be used in any materials that could mislead readers by narrowly interpreting a broad application security category. For example, a vendor product that can find or protect against forced browsing must not claim that they address all of the access control category.''

* [http://www.embedded-computing.com/news/db/?5197 Java Source Code Analysis Available for Developers to Improve Software Security and Quality] - quote ''"Java Security Analysis Aligned with OWASP -- KDJ's vulnerability analysis provides excellent coverage of the vulnerabilities from the OWASP Top 10 list."''
* [http://www.marketwire.com/mw/release_html_b1?release_id=208677 Ounce Labs Simplifies Regulatory and Policy Compliance With New SmartAudit] - quote : ''"1. OWASP Top Ten: Identifies the existence and location in the source code of any of the Top 10 most critical web application security vulnerabilities, a list complied by the Open Web Application Security Project."''

The problem with these claims is that it is very hard to know what exactly do they mean. At least in KDJ's case they say ''"...excellent coverage..."'' versus Ounce Labs' ''"...any of the Top 10..."''.

One idea that is currently being debated is if OWASP brand usage rules should state that if a company makes claims such as the ones above in relation with the OWASP Top 10 (or other OWASP materials), they MUST include a reference to a publicly accessible page that ‘explains’ how well they ‘think’ each element of the Top 10 is covered.
