: Bruce Schneier finally chimes in on an [[http://www.aspectsecurity.com/documents/Aspect_HCSS_Unsafe_At_Any_Speed.ppt old OWASP theme]] - the problem of assymetric information between software buyers and sellers. He only talks about security products, but the same problem affects all types of software. Check the [[http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Types_of_application_security_metrics Software Facts Label] which is an idea for actually doing something to change the game.

; '''Apr 10 - [http://www.csoonline.com/alarmed/?source=nlt_csoupdate "There is no hope"]'''
: Despite all the good stuff at OWASP, Scott Berinato is giving up. "No official announcement is forthcoming, but the Internet is broken and it can't be repaired. Oh, it's still there. You can still use it. Then again, if you went hiking and came across an old, broken-down mine shaft, you could still use that, too."

:Provides a nice proof of concept with CNN (Link at the bottom). "Internet Explorer 7.0 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting in one of its local resources. In combination with a design flaw in this specific local resource it is possible for an attacker to easily conduct phishing attacks against IE7 users." CNET News also picked this up as a [http://news.com.com/2100-1002_3-6167410.html?part=rss&tag=2547-1_3-0-20&subj=news story].

:Only a tiny XSS hole to demonstrate a disclosure proof-of-concept through AJAX/JSON of all contacts you ever mailed. If a domains covers a lot of functionality and users, one XSS can be devastating. Remember the Google Desktop vulnerability. What is frightening is that it took Beni only ~5 minutes to find a XSS hole.

; '''Mar 8 -  [http://myappsecurity.blogspot.com/search/label/reflection Anurag Agarwal's reflection series]'''
:Anurag Agarwal maintains an interesting [http://myappsecurity.blogspot.com/ blog] on Web Application Security. Recently he started a serie of reflections on people active in this field.

; '''Feb 05 - [http://www.itsecurity.com/security.htm?s=10164 Why Your Organization Must Increase It's Web Application Security Budget]'''
:"The Web application security threat is a real one. A failure to respond to this threat will result in real risk to any enterprise that stores financial or customer data. While the problem is a serious one, it is not something that cannot be fixed so long as proper attention and budget are allocated to it. Unfortunately, given the unique nature of the problem and its impact on the budgetary process, it will likely require direct intervention by the financial staff."

; '''Feb 05 - [http://www10.mcadcafe.com/nbc/articles/view_article.php?section=CorpNews&articleid=347382 X-Force Notes Increase in Vulnerabilities. Where are the "X-Men" to fix them?]'''
:" According to the report, which was developed by the IBM Internet Security Systems (ISS) X-Force(R) research and development team, there were 7,247 new vulnerabilities recorded and analyzed by the X-Force in 2006, which equates to an average of 20 new vulnerabilities per day. This total represents a nearly 40 percent increase over what ISS reported in 2005. Over 88 percent of 2006 vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely, and over 50 percent allowed attackers to gain access to a machine after exploitation. "

; '''Feb 05 - [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/avi-rubin/bad-software-all-around_b_40119.html Rubin Smacks Diebold Once Again]'''
:"Given what I've seen about voting system standards and voting system testing labs, I would bet money that the parking garage system at Baltimore Penn Station was tested more extensively before it was deployed than the Diebold voting machines that we use in Maryland."

: He lies. Especially about security flaws. This article notes an increase in vulnerabilities found in open source packages and concludes that... "For the personal sites and the mom-and-pop stores that rely on the software, it certainly affects them," Martin said. "But larger companies likely aren't affected."  Right.

; '''Jan 18 - [http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2007/01/web-application-security-professionals.html  Web Application Security Professionals Survey (Jan. 2007)]'''
: Jeremiah Grossman just released his (unscientific) survey with lots of very interesting data. Make sure you check out section '11) Top 3 web application security resources' which is a nice database of the most popular vulnerability assessment tools and knowledge resources (#1 was RSnake's Blog, and #2 was OWASP :) )

; '''Jan 18 - [http://www.scmagazine.com/asia/news/article/626120/hackers-attack-moneygram-international-server-breach-personal-info-80000-customers/ Hackers attack MoneyGram International server, breach personal info of 80,000 customers]'''
: A MoneyGram International server has been breached, allowing cybercrooks access to the personal information of nearly 80,000 people. Hackers accessed the server through the web sometime last month, the money-transfer company said in a statement released on Friday.

; '''Jan 3 - [http://www2.csoonline.com/exclusives/column.html?CID=28073 http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/danger-danger-danger/ XSS in ALL sites with PDF download]'''
: Critical XSS flaw that is trivial to exploit here in all but the very latest browsers. Attackers simply have to add a script like #attack=javascript:alert(document.cookie); to ANY URL that ends in .pdf (or streams a PDF). Solution is to not use PDF's or for Adobe to patch the planet.

; '''Dec 18 - [http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11430 PHP security under scrutiny]'''
: Perhaps PHP should stand for Pretty Hard to Protect: A week after a prominent bug finder and developer left the PHP Group, data from the National Vulnerability Database has underscored the need for better security in PHP-based Web applications. 

; '''Dec 16 - [http://www.cafeaulait.org What IS security critical code?]'''
: "It's likely that in most incidents of people being killed as a result of software bugs (or IT systems bugs), the software wasn't thought to be safety-critical at all. For example, a word-processor failing to recognize that a print request has failed, resulting in a patient not getting a letter giving a hospital appointment. Or someone committing suicide because of an incorrect bank statement." Michael Kay on the xml-dev list, 8/17/2005

; '''Dec 14 - [http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2006/12/i-know-if-youre-logged-in-anywhere.html JavaScript error handler leaks information]'''
: An attacker can find out whether you're logged into your favorite website or not. They include a script tag where the src attribute doesn't point to a script, but instead to a page on your favorite websites. Based on the error the script parser generates when trying to parse the HTML of the page that's returned, the attacker can tell whether you're logged in or not. Should extend to access control easily. Protect yourself with CSRF protection.

; '''Dec 13 - [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/12/AR2006121200173.html UCLA spins massive breach]'''
: Why not just say what measures you've really taken? Are all developers trained? Do you do code review and security testing? "Jim Davis, UCLA's chief information officer, said a computer trespasser used a program designed to exploit an undetected software flaw to bypass all security measures and gain access to the restricted database that contains information on about 800,000 current and former students, faculty and staff, as well as some student applicants and parents of students or applicants who applied for financial aid. 'In spite of our diligence, a sophisticated hacker found and exploited a subtle vulnerability in one of hundreds of applications,' Davis said in the statement."

; '''Dec 2 - [http://blogs.oracle.com/security/2006/11/27#a39 Oracle blames security researchers]'''
: "We do not credit security researchers who disclose the existence of vulnerabilities before a fix is available. We consider such practices, including disclosing 'zero day' exploits, to be irresponsible." So the question on everybody's mind - is the [http://www.oracle.com/security/software-security-assurance.html Oracle Software Security Assurance] program real? Or are David Litchfield and Cesar Cerrudo right that Emperor has no clothes?

; '''Nov 30 - [http://www.whitehatsec.com/home/resources/articles/files/myth_busting_ajax_insecurity.html What? Ajax is secure now?]'''
: Nice article making the point that Ajax is not inherently insecure. Read it carefully folks - it isn't easy to build a secure Ajax application, just possible. And remember that although the article doesn't mention it, Ajax apps use new parsers and interpreters that haven't been very well tested for security.

; '''Nov 30 - [http://vote.nist.gov/DraftWhitePaperOnSIinVVSG2007-20061120.pdf Democracy Schlemocracy]'''
: A paper from NIST argues that touchscreen voting machines are "more vulnerable to undetected programming errors or malicious code" and that "potentially, a single programmer could 'rig' a major election."

; [[Image:Database_security_comparison.jpg|right|200px]]'''Nov 28 - [http://www.databasesecurity.com/dbsec/comparison.pdf Litchfield slams Oracle lack of SDL]'''
: David Litchfield presents some very compelling evidence that Microsoft's SDL is paying off. A very interesting read. Not surprisingly, Microsoft is [http://blogs.msdn.com/michael_howard/archive/2006/11/22/microsoft-beats-oracle-in-security-showdown.aspx gloating] a little.

; '''Nov 28 - [http://link Foreign software - threat or xenophobia?]'''
: Ira Winkler - "If there is one line of code written overseas, that’s one line too many. Developing it in the U.S. is not perfect, but we are talking about an exponential increase in risk by moving it overseas." John Pescatore - the focus on offshore developers is "xenophobia" but said the software security concerns raised by the DOD should serve as a useful wake-up call for all organizations that buy software.

; '''Nov 27 - [http://myappsecurity.blogspot.com/2006/11/comparison-between-appscan-vs.html Scanner smackdown results]'''
:  "Last month I got a chance to evaluate the two popular vulnerability assessment tools Webinspect and Appscan and I wanted to share my findings with others..." 

; '''Nov 27 [http://www.viruslist.com/en/analysis?pubid=204791907 Malware evolution - third wave coming?]'''
: "All the events of the third quarter of 2006 lead me to conclude that both the Internet and the field of information security are on the verge of something totally new. I would say that the second stage of both virus and antivirus evolution is now complete. The first stage was during the 1990s, which simple signature detection was enough to combat simple viruses. At this stage, malicious code was not highly technical and did not use complex infection methods."

; '''Nov 26 - [http://www.esecurityplanet.com/print.php/3642321 The security snooze button]'''
: Great article by Ken van Wyk. He looks at the 41% increase in published software vulnerabilities and points out that there is not a corresponding 41% increase in the amount of software, a 41% more people looking for vulnerabilities, or more researchers looking. He concludes there's a significant shift in profit motive. Caveat browsor.

; '''Nov 21 - [http://www.csoonline.com/read/110106/fea_strong_auth_pf.html Why two-factor sucks]'''
: "More than 90 percent of the participants in several focus groups said they didn't want to use a token to access accounts online or by phone. "The response we got was, 'Don't tell me I have to carry something to get access to my money. It's your job to protect my money, and if you don't do your job I'll find someone who will,'" says Cullinane, who is CISO of Washington Mutual, the nation's largest savings bank. "It was rather startling to get that from them."

; '''Nov 13 - [http://searchappsecurity.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid92_gci1229301,00.html Growing interest in securing SDLC]'''
: "It's becoming an emerging area of interest for enterprises to address application portfolios and review their applications for security. The other angle is, when developing code, making sure that security is taken into consideration throughout the SDLC, instead of just testing during QA prior to GA or prior to releasing to production."

; '''Nov 9 - [http://www.enterprisestrategygroup.com/ESGPublications/ReportListings.asp?ReportType=briefs SDL 2008 or bust!]'''
: "ESG believes that other ISVs should embrace an SDL model as soon as possible and that enterprise organizations should mandate that technology vendors establish a measurable and transparent SDL process by 2008 or risk losing business."

; '''Nov 7 - [http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/jbrofuzz JBroFuzz 0.2 Network Protocol Fuzzer Released]'''
:JBroFuzz is a stateless network protocol fuzzer for penetration tests. Written in Java (exe also available) it provides a number of generators, as well as basic checks involving SQL injection, Cross Site Scripting (XSS), Buffer/Integer Overflows, as well as Format String Errors.

: Micheal Sutton experimented with a survey of sites that have a parameter named "id" in the URL. He finds that 11.3% of them cough up a SQL error. "The statistics are significant as they provide evidence of the prevalence of web application vulnerabilities. Coverage of this issue has however been somewhat misleading as reports have suggested that it is a measure of what attackers are doing."

; '''Nov 1 - [http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=109150 Don't blame the browser]'''
: Client side applications are all intertwined, and a flaw in one may compromise the rest. But don't forget the web applications!

: "Hackers have been breaking into customer accounts at large online brokerages in the United States and making unauthorized trades worth millions of dollars as part of a fast-growing new form of online fraud under investigation by federal authorities. E-Trade Financial Corp. said last week that "concerted rings" in Eastern Europe and Thailand caused their customers $18 million in losses in the third quarter alone. Another company, TD Ameritrade, the third-largest online broker, also has suffered losses from customer account fraud, but a spokeswoman declined to quantify the amount yesterday. "It is an industry problem. It does continue to grow."

: All you did was load a web page - how did that add movies to my Netflix account? [[Cross-Site Request Forgery]] attacks are usually as simple as image links to another site. If you're logged in, the attack succeeds. Netflix got burned, but many sites are susceptible to this attack.

; '''Oct 17 - [http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/sep2006/tc20060926_175459.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index Bill Joy gets religion]'''
: Welcome Bill! "Rather than simply building big walls around their networks, developers must become proactive about security and include it from the beginning of an application's development. They must consider the possible threats to the system and review source code-the software's blueprint-for security flaws, thereby vastly improving overall security."

; '''Oct 17 - [http://www.securityfocus.com/columnists/334 Marcus Ranum disses IPv6]'''
: "IPv6 is just another network protocol, and if you look at where the problems are occurring in computer security, they're largely up in application space. From a security standpoint IPv6 adds very little that could offer an improvement: in return for the addition of some encryption and machine-to-machine authentication, we get a great deal of additional complexity. The additional complexity of the IPv6 stack will certainly prove to be the home of all kinds of fascinating new bugs and denial-of-service attacks."

; '''Oct 15 - [http://link RSnake says IE7 sucks less for XSS]'''
: Everybody revamp your blacklists (wish you'd done a whitelist now?) - "IE7.0 appears to be quite an improvement in overall security though. I’m glad the JavaScript directive has been relegated to IFRAMEs and HREFs rather than being possible anywhere a location was - thereby definitely reducing the attack surface for the newest browser from Microsoft"

; '''Oct 15 - [http://www.csoonline.com.au/index.php/id;116770232;fp;16;fpid;0 AppSec like global warming...]'''
: You can never be exactly sure what's going on, but something is definitely up. "The biggest single classes of vulnerabilities in 2006 so far, according to ISS, would allow [[cross-site scripting]] (14.5 percent), [[SQL injection]] (10.9 percent); [[Buffer Overflow|buffer overflows]] (10.8 percent) and Web directory [[path traversal]] (3 percent).

; '''Oct 6 - [http://www.wired.com/news/technology/security/0,71902-0.html Ajax is FUD-tastic]'''
: News flash: it is possible to write an insecure Ajax application, especially if you don't understand the technology. But that's no different from any programming environment. We need [[OWASP AJAX Security Project|guidelines]] and more research, not more FUD.

; '''Oct 3 - [http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2006/09/csrf-sleeping-giant.html  CSRF, the sleeping giant]''' 
: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (aka CSRF or XSRF) is a dangerous vulnerability present in just about every website. An issue so pervasion and fundamental to the way the Web is designed to function we've had a difficult time even reporting it as a "vulnerability". Which is also a main reason why CSRF does not appear on the Web Security Threat Classification or the OWASP Top 10. Times are changing and it’s only a matter of time before CSRF hacks its way into the mainstream consciousness." (Ed: We're revising the Top 10 for 2007 - feel free to come join us!)

; '''Oct 3 - [http://shiflett.org/archive/267 crossdomain.xml witch hunt]''' 
: crossdomain.xml allows Flash-based CSRF attacks. Chris Shiflett demonstrates how to report such problems and work with the site owners to fix a potentially damaging loophole. "After disclosing the security vulnerability in Flickr (a result of its crossdomain.xml policy), a number of other major web sites have been identified as being vulnerable to the same exploit - using cross-domain Ajax requests for CSRF. Among these new discoveries are YouTube, Adobe, and MusicBrainz."

; '''Oct 2 - [http://searchappsecurity.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid92_gci1219789,00.html Static analysis - an important part of a balanced breakfast]'''
: "The fact that we can say we do a code review as part of our development process gives [customers] comfort, and it demonstrates the maturity of our risk management process when it comes to code, and the fact that it's part of our overall program."

; '''Oct 2 - [http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-fuzztest.html Fuzz testing in Java]'''
: "Of course, error handling and verification is ugly, annoying, inconvenient, and thoroughly despised by programmers the world over. Sixty years into the computer age, we still aren't checking basic things like the success of opening a file or whether memory allocation succeeds. Asking programmers to test each byte and every invariant when reading a file seems hopeless -- but failing to do so leaves your programs vulnerable to fuzz."

; '''Oct 2 - [http://www.newsobserver.com/104/story/493117.html Data breaches reaching ridiculous levels]'''
