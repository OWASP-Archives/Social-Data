== How to Request OWASP Merchandise ==

In response to so many requests for OWASP Gear, we have made arrangements with a vendor, Konik Company, for chapter leaders to purchase some items using their [https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/owasp.org/pub?key=0Atu4kyR3ljftdF9aZkY0YjRFcmNBY21OaWo3djdkUXc&hl=en&output=html available chapter funds]. Additionally, if you do not have chapter funds to cover your request, you may ask the Global Chapters Committee to help pay for merchandise to use at chapter meetings and local events.

Please complete the '''[https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dF85bGtvdWdrd2JjYldNZ1gxSkJxaEE6MQ Merchandise Request Form]''' and we will get back to you quickly regarding your request.  Please contact [mailto:sarah.baso@owasp.org Sarah Baso] with any questions regarding merchandise orders.
