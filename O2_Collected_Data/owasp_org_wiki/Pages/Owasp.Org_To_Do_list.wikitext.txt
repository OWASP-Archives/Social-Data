This page contains list of to-dos (from action points to ideas) on the owasp.org website (note that this is not about content but about structure)

* Create a Firefox plug-in for searching Owasp.org. [[User:Dinis.cruz|Dinis.cruz]]
* create a Downloadable 'Offline copy' of the Owasp.org site. [[User:Dinis.cruz|Dinis.cruz]]

'' Completed ''

* Allow the upload of *.zip files so that don't have to rename them *.ppt :)  [[User:esheridan|Eric]]
* Add a 'Google owasp.org' search feature since the current Wiki Search sucks. [[User:Laurence Casey|Laurence Casey]]
