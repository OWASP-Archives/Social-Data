| project_name = Security Ecosystem Project
| project_description = Nobody (and no company) can build secure software by themselves. We have seen that vulnerability research can help to drive security forward in companies, but itâ€™s a painful process. We envision a partnership between technology platform vendors and a thriving ecosystem focused on the security of their technology. The ecosystem will include researchers (both builders and breakers), tools, libraries, guidelines, awareness materials, standards, education, conferences, forums, feeds, announcements, and probably more.
