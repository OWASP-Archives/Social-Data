The August 15 meeting was held at Woodward Hall room 130.  Our speaker was [[User:John Melton|John Melton]], developer for the [[OWASP AppSensor Project]].  Pizza was provided.

The chapter decided that as a chapter project we should begin getting involved in the [[OWASP AppSensor Project]] in various degrees.  [[User:John Melton|John]] will begin working out a list of open bugs and enhancement requests.  Also, members of the chapter are encouraged to begin looking at implementing AppSensor in other languages (PHP had the highest interest level during the meeting), being sure to make it compatible as much as possible with [[:Category:OWASP Enterprise Security API|ESAPI]] and the current Java implementation of AppSensor.
