<br> '''What Are OWASP Communities?'''

[http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Builders Builders], Breakers and [http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Defenders Defenders]; the idea of OWASP Communities is to bring together experts in the area that they are best at with the common goal of advancing the state of application security.  This approach allows similar groups of professionals and experts to tackle security problems with the involvement of the most relevant stakeholders.  The intent is to drive high quality output that is immediately usable by the target audience.  More information about this vision can be found [http://michael-coates.blogspot.com/2011/02/vision-for-owasp.html here]
