 '''Meeting Location - VERIFIED'''

The Huntsville chapter Committee met today (Feb 27,2010) and have official secured several high quality meeting locations. The first public meeting will be held at the new SAIC(SAIC.com) location in Huntsville’s Research Park. SAIC has also mentioned that we will have continual access to the conference room depending on the number of attendees.

TThe SAIC conference room that is currently approved will hold approximately 10-15 attendees comfortably. Other approved locations include the new CB&amp;S Bank downtown location, and Intergraph in Huntsville. The CB&amp;S conference room i will hold 12-17 and if additional space is required Intergraph has an auditorium that would be accessible. Based on other groups, we estimate 10-30 attendees for the initial March meeting (March 24, 2010) 
 
 

 ''When the Chapter meets''

The Huntsville OWASP Chapter will meet the third (3rd) Wednesday of every month. The first meeting will be in March 2010. However, due to spring break, the first public meeting will be re-scheduled to March 24, 2010. The normal meeting schedule will return in April, and the projected date is April 12-2010. Location will vary depending on RSVP. 
 
 

The March 24, 2010 meeting will provide an overview of OWASP and include high level information on projects, funding, current news, future plans, and an open discussion on the local Huntsville Chapter. A&nbsp;short presentation on OWASP&nbsp;will be provided by Joshua Perrymon, who will then open the meeting to the open discussion. We urge you to attend to better understand OWASP, what the Huntsville chapter is planning, and to provide feedback on current application security issues.
<pre>Chapter Meeting Times/ Schedule</pre>
11:30 -11:45 : Lunch / Social<br>11:45 -12:00 : Chapter News /Updates<br>12:00-:12:30-12:45 Talk (This is variable based on content and type of presenation)&nbsp;<br>12:45-1:00- Open Discussion / Q&amp;A / FeedBack for next meetings content<br>

* This is a rough schedule, but we will attempt to stick to it as close as possible. If presentations are to be over an hour appropriate announcements will be made ahead of time for scheduling. We understand that everyone can't be out of the office for several hours, and want to pack as much value and content into the alloted time as possible. The goal is for each atendee to walk away with usable information and value. If we are not doing that, thencontact us and let us know how to improve our meeting process.

 ''Potential Training/ 1-day Application Security Conference Idea''

We have discussed having a one day conference focused on Application Security. Tracks would be based on OWASP content, projects, methods, etc and how to put it all together to create and maintain an effective application security program.
 

Tracks/Session may be split based on technical and management focused material. This may be held Q4 2010 depending on community feedback, planning and budget. We can also start on a smaller scale to define a workable model before investing in a much larger event.&nbsp; 
 

Attendees would be charged an affordable fee of $100-$250 with proceeds from the conference going directly into the Chapters OWASP&nbsp;PayPal fund. Vendor space would be available to help support the event as well.

'''Why Should I Become An OWASP Member or Organization Supporter''' 

OWASP provides documentation, tools, methodologies, standards, articles, and message forums (“OWASP Materials”) as a service to Internet users worldwide to help users and developers understand more about application security. OWASP makes these materials available to end users to help them acquire, build, test, and operate secure software. In addition to the benefits you receive as described above, your membership helps to support the growth of OWASP and the development of new and improved OWASP Materials. Because we are an open, non-commercial entity, we can take on projects that commercial entities driven by profit motives could not. Everyone benefits from these projects. Your support will help OWASP continue to find and fight the causes of insecure software.
