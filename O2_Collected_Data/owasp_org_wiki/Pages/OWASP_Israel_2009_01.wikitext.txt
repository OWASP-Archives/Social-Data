: Not a future but a present, Web 2.0 technologies and services are here to stay. Prophecies of Web 2.0 insecurity are age old, but only now real threats such as the recent [http://www.xiom.com/whid-2009-4 Twitter JSON bug] start to emerge. Nimrod will prove by using real world stories and demos how insecure Web 2.0 applications can be.
: Nimrod Luria is an acclaimed application security expert who has recently founded Qrity, a promising startup. Previously he was a member of Microsoft ACE team.
; Wiki Security, Ofer Shezaf, Xiom ([http://www.xiom.com/research/wiki_security download])
: Wiki is a revolutionary tool for creation and sharing of content by a team. To be revolutionary it needs to make radical changes from prevailing paradigms, and one of the key changes is in its security model: Wiki forgo with traditional authorization for revision control. The presentation will discuss this new security model as well as what it required in regard to more traditional application security issues.
: Ofer Shezaf is the leader of OWASP Israel. Ofer is the fonder of Xiom, a web application firewall research, services and support company. Previously Ofer served as VP of Product Management and VP of Security Research at Breach Security, a web application firewalls vendor.
