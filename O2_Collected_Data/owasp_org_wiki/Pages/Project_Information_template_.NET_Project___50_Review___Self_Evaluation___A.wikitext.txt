1. At what extent have the project deliveries & objectives been accomplished?  Having in consideration [[OWASP Summer of Code 2008 Applications#OWASP .NET Project Leader|'''the assumed ones''']], please exemplify writing down those of them that haven't been realised.
 | colspan="2" style="width:75%; background:#cccccc" align="left"|I have a decent amount of 3rd party content.  I think more OWASP provided content is needed.  I also want to tie all of the roles pages together for lifecycle guidance.  Vulnerability research needs to be worked on.  I thought this would be popular and useful (I still think is useful, but I need advice how to inspire folks to help).  A summary of my work for SOC 2008 is here [http://owaspdotnet.blogspot.com/2008/06/catching-up-with-summer-of-code-2008.html Catching up with Summer of Code 2008]

3. What kind of help is required either from the Reviewers or from the OWASP Community?
 | colspan="2" style="width:75%; background:#cccccc" align="left"|I would appreciate any feedback regarding conformance with OWASP standards and suitability of materials for the wiki.  Regarding outreach and OWASP representation, I would appreciate any advice how to maintain a level of activity in the community.  What types of things should I be doing that I am not and vice-versa.  A feedback loop would be helpful.
