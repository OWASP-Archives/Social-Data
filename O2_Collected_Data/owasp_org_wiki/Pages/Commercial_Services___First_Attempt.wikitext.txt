OWASP's mission is to make application security "visible," so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about application security risks, and as a value-add towards this end we have attempted to centralize OWASP project deliverable-based services for you in a single OWASP Commercial Services Registry. OWASP is not affiliated with any technology company, and '''''OWASP does not endorse commercial products or services''''', although we support the informed use of commercial security technology, and that is the ultimate goal of this registry. 

Encouraging the formation of commercial services (verification, implementation services, process improvement, and training) benefits both industry and OWASP by promoting the development and consumption by industry and government of tools and techniques that are based on OWASP open standards, best practices and design patterns. Similar to many open-source software projects, OWASP produces many types of materials in a collaborative, open way. The OWASP Foundation is a not-for-profit entity that ensures the project’s long-term success, providing sound foundations to build commercial services upon.

Firms listed in this registry follow strict rules to ensure the preservation of OWASP’s non-commercial nature. Firms listed in this registry share our belief that application security needs to be approached as a people, process, and technology problem, because the most effective approaches to application security include improvements in all of these areas.

== Get Listed  ==

[[Image:Asvs-bulb.jpg|link=]]'''How to get your company listed''' 

To be listed in the OWASP Commercial Services Registry, contact [http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Contact Kate Hartmann]. 

'''Question: What do you need from us?'''

'''Answer:''' For each type of service (Verification, Implementation Services, Process Improvement, and Training), one has to first choose what services of a given type one is offering. For example, for Verification, one can choose from any combination of ASVS levels 1A, 1B, 1, 2A, 2B, 2, 3, 4. Next, one has to provide the information requested in the paragraph above the table, let's keep using Verification as an example, starting from the second half of the paragraph: "Provider listings are required to include the following information..." -- this sentence provides a list of the information needed. The "Acme Application Security Co." is a fictional company listing that provides an example of a listing that provides the needed information.

'''Question:''' How many categories can we be listed under (we fall under a couple)

'''Answer:''' You can be listed once for each type of service (Verification, Implementation Services, Process Improvement, and Training). So, one company could have up to four listings, one on each tab. Then, in each listing, one can include one or more specific services of that type. The "Acme Application Security Co." is a fictional company on the Verification tab for example provides both ASVS Level 1A and 1B verification services.

Please let Kate know if you have any further questions, or need any additional information.
