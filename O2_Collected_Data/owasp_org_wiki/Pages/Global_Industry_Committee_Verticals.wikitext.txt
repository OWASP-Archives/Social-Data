==== Welcome! ====
'''The Global Industry Committee was created during the OWASP EU Summit in Portugal. The primary purpose of the Global Industry Committee is to work with industry executives to gather requirements from industry, work with Membership, Projects and others.''' 

== Mission Statement  ==

''To expand awareness of and promote the inclusion of software security best practices in Industry, Government, Academia and regulatory agencies and be a voice for industry. We will accomplish this through outreach; including presentations, development of position papers and collaborative efforts with other entities.''

<br>

== Committee Plan  ==

Step 1: [[Industry:Organizations for Outreach|Identify specific organizations]] worth working with to spread the OWASP gospel 

Step 2: Prioritize the proposed liaisons based on potential impact, and also realistic likelihood of the organization actively working with us 

Step 3: Execute, leveraging global OWASP resources as much as possible to maximize impact 

Step 4: Evaluate progress &amp; repeat Step 1-3

=== Membership  ===

[[Membership]] explains how to become an OWASP organization supporter or individual member. But you don't have to be an OWASP Member or Committee Member to contribute. 

The current committee members joined for a 12 month term - see [[How to Join a Committee]] and [[Global Committee Pages]]. We would especially welcome new members who can widen our geographic coverage (e.g. Africa, Asia and South America) and who have time to contribute proactively.
