'''PRESS RELEASE''' <br/>
'''Hello World!  OWASP Summit 2011 Kicks Off Massive Outreach Program'''
|-
| align="center" | '' “I saw the ‘blossoming’ of OWASP in Portugal’s Spring. From an external viewpoint, OWASP has moved from niche to widely relevant, from localized to global, from pentesting to SDLC, from server to every component of the application’s delivery and use, from infosec to business process relevance.”'' – Colin Watson

| align="left" | '''Lisbon, Portugal''', February 15, 2011 - The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) today announced the results from its 2011 OWASP Summit. Over 180 application security experts from over 120 companies and 30 different countries joined forces to plan, build, and execute programs to improve the security of the world’s software applications.  The Summit was a significant step towards OWASP’s mission to ensure all types of organizations are empowered to build, select, and use software applications securely.


OWASP launched and advanced dozens of concrete initiatives to bring application security to governments, educational institutions, browser vendors, standards bodies, software development teams, and mobile platform vendors. Delegates gathered outside Lisbon, Portugal for a week of interactive working sessions and discussions. OWASP Summits are unlike conferences with static presentations. Instead, working sessions are used to author documents, create software, draft standards, and forge lasting relationships.


'''Some highlights from the 2011 OWASP Summit include:'''
*'''OWASP-Portugal Partnership''' – OWASP has been working to establish relationships with various governments around the world, particularly the United States, Brazil, Portugal, and Greece. At the Summit, OWASP representatives worked directly with senior Portuguese IT officials to establish a protocol for working with Portugal to improve their application security capabilities.

*'''OWASP Outreach to Educational Institutions''' – Reaching students is a unique opportunity to reach developers early in their development. At the Summit, delegates drafted an OWASP Code of Conduct for Educational Institutions, created a detailed plan for OWASP Student Chapters and continued development of the OWASP “Academies” Portal with extensive education and training materials.

*'''OWASP Industry Outreach''' – OWASP resolved to develop industry working sessions to be held at major OWASP conferences starting with OWASP EU 2011 in Dublin, Ireland. The objective of these sessions will be to solicit feedback from industry players to help better focus OWASP efforts and make sure OWASP deliverables are relevant to industry concerns.

*'''OWASP Browser Security Project''' – The Summit brought representatives from browser vendors Mozilla, Google, and Microsoft together with leading security researchers to discuss, and strategize about browser security issues. Several new OWASP initiatives were launched, including a browser security scorecard project based on OWASP’s recently created browser testing framework. There were extensive discussions on browser initiatives such as Mozilla’s Content Security Policy (CSP) and browser sandboxes.

*'''OWASP-Apache Partnership''' – OWASP forged a relationship with the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) to start the process of sharing OWASP software projects with the ASF with the intention of including OWASP-provided code in Apache projects. The intention of this collaboration is to improve the security of the widely-used ASF Open Source software, as well to improve visibility for OWASP efforts.

*'''OWASP Mobile Security Initiative''' – OWASP made progress on their upcoming Top 10 Mobile Vulnerabilities and Top 10 Mobile Defenses lists. In addition, OWASP resolved to reach out to mobile platform vendors to work with them on integrating better security into their environments.

*'''OWASP Governance Expansion''' – OWASP updated its Charter and worked out procedures for the upcoming Board elections. These governance updates will help best support the dynamic and growing OWASP community.

*'''International Focus''' – OWASP reaffirmed a commitment to be a truly international organization. Delegations from several countries and regions around the world including Asia-Pacific and South America participated in outreach workshops. Addition focus has been given to expanding international representation on OWASP’s Board and Global Committees.

*'''Application Security Programs''' – To help organizations actually implement application security programs, we are mapping OWASP projects to all major approaches, including OWASP OpenSAMM, Microsoft’s SDL, and BSIMM.

*'''Application Security Certification''' – OWASP reaffirmed its commitment to avoid becoming a certification body. Instead, it created the OWASP Code of Conduct for Certification Bodies that defines what application security certification program should entail.


''The full results of the Summit will be captured and released as an OWASP Report. The results will be released for comment and then ratified as a final deliverable. For more information, including notes, video, pictures, and other deliverables, please visit www.owasp.org.''

'''ABOUT THE OWASP SUMMIT'''

OWASP Summits are where application security experts can meet in a neutral non-commercial setting to discuss plans, projects and solutions for the future of application security.

'''The Summit is NOT a conference''' - there are no talks or training seminars. This is an opportunity to do actual work to further the field of application security. Participants will stay in shared accommodations and collaborate to produce tangible progress towards influencing standards, establishing roadmaps, and setting the tone for OWASP and application security for the coming years. 

Anyone can attend the Summit! OWASP community members, application security experts, industry players, and developers are all welcome at the Summit. Attendees come ready to work and produce deliverables that advance the state-of-the-art in application security.
    
Many of the working sessions were created “dynamically” by the attendees. Anyone can propose a new working session, sign up for a room and time slot, and meet to work with other interested parties. Many of the main sessions ended up spawning multiple dynamic sessions to accomplish particular goals.
Much of the work that goes on at the Summit is at meals, social events, or hallways. We live together, eat together, and play together. We work hard and play hard for a solid week focused on application security.  Even the OWASP Band is free and open for anyone to participate.
