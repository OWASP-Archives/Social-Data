The overall content is great. I think that the wiki and the pdf could use more formatting. With the Content section of the wiki it would be nice to  have a link to each subsection. This is mainly because as the document grows it will become required for easy navigation. The PDF needs two things. The first is a clickable index like in documents created with PDF writer. The second is code boxing. This is where people put boxes/outlines around code which makes it easier to read.

1. Having into consideration the [[:Category:OWASP Project Assessment|OWASP Project Assessment Methodology]] which criteria, if any, haven’t been fulfilled in terms of '''Alpha Quality''' status?
 | colspan="2" style="width:75%; background:#cccccc" align="left"|
All Alpha quality criteria have been met except for the mailing list. This may be in place and I am just unaware of it. If this is so, then there should be a link on the project page for people to join so that they are also aware that they can get updates on the project.
