= HTML5 resources =

* [http://www.w3.org/html/wg/html5/ HTML 5 editor's draft]
* [http://dev.w3.org/html5/pubnotes/ HTML 5 publication notes]
* [http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker Web interface to specification changes]
* [http://twitter.com/whatwg Major changes as a twitter feed]
* [http://www.w3.org/html/wg/ HTML Working Group Home Page]

Specific parts of the specification that were mentioned during the talk:

* [http://www.w3.org/html/wg/html5/#windows Browsing contexts]; [http://www.w3.org/html/wg/html5/#security6 navigation policy]
* [http://www.w3.org/html/wg/html5/#origin Origin]
* [http://www.w3.org/html/wg/html5/#custom-handlers Custom protocol and content handlers]
* [http://www.w3.org/html/wg/html5/#offline Offline Web Applications]
* [http://www.w3.org/html/wg/html5/#structured Structured client-side storge]
* [http://www.w3.org/html/wg/html5/#crossDocumentMessages Cross Document Messaging] (aka postMessage)
* [http://www.w3.org/html/wg/html5/#server-sent-events server-sent DOM events]
* [http://www.w3.org/html/wg/html5/#network Network connections]

Also of interest, but added even more recently:

* [http://www.w3.org/html/wg/html5/#sandbox iframe sandboxing]; [http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapi/2008May/0326.html summary of concepts]

= Cross-domain XMLHttpRequest =

* [http://dev.w3.org/2006/waf/access-control/ access-control editor's draft]
* [http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/XMLHttpRequest-2/ XMLHttpRequest Level 2 editor's draft]

Note that the "access-control" specification provides a mechanism for authorizing exceptions to the same-origin policy. How that authorization (and the data retrieved) is used isn't actually specified. For XMLHttpRequest, the governing specification is XMLHttpRequest Level 2.  Don't read one without the other.

Also relevant:

* [http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-appformats/2008Mar/0017.html IE Team's proposal for Cross Site Requests] (XDomainRequest)

Relevant work is currently occuring in the [http://www.w3.org/2006/webapi/ Web API] and [http://www.w3.org/2006/appformats/ Web Application Formats] Working Groups at W3C. A [http://www.w3.org/2007/12/WebApps-Charter-2007 proposed restructuring] of that work is currently being negotiated.
