==Description==

This looks like an effort to override a common Java method, but it probably does not have the intended effect.

This method's name is similar to a common Java method name, but it is either spelled incorrectly or the argument list causes it to not override the intended method.

==Risk Factors==
TBD

==Examples ==

The following method is meant to override Object.equals():

<pre>
	public boolean equals(Object obj1, Object obj2) {
	  ...
	}
</pre>

But since Object.equals() only takes a single argument, the method above is never called.
