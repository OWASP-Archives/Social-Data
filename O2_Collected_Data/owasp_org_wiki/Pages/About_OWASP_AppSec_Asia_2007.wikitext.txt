[http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_AppSec_Conference OWASP AppSec conference] will be held in Asia for the first time in Taipei, Taiwan on September 27, 2007. The [[OWASP AppSec Asia 2007]] event has been covered by [http://udn.com/UDN/UDNENGLISH/edn.htm Economic Daily News], Taiwan’s largest business daily, [http://www.ithome.com.tw/ iThome], Taiwan’s largest IT weekly, [http://www.informationsecurity.com.tw/ Information Security Magazine], Taiwan’s largest security monthly, [http://www.digitimes.com/index.asp DigiTimes], Taiwan’s largest online IT media, etc. It has more than 450 people registering so far with some participants from China and Japan. 

The selected two sponsors for this OWASP Asia conference are both non-profit organizations. One is III, the [http://www.iii.org.tw/english/ Institute for Information Industry], which is a government-funded non-profit organization that is responsible for driving Taiwan’s software industry. The other sponsor is the [http://www.tisc.org.tw/ Information Security Consortium (ISC)] of the [http://web.cisanet.org.tw/index3.html Information Service Industry Association], which is also a non-profit organization with a dedicated task force to promote security in Taiwan. Executives from both organizations will give short opening in [[OWASP AppSec Asia 2007]] as they have carried most of the responsibilities in promoting security awareness and growing the security market in Taiwan. 

This year's [[OWASP AppSec Asia 2007]] is neutral and no vendor's name and logo will appear on any of the press coverage / emails / flag / banners. The only three logos are [http://www.owasp.org/ OWASP], [http://www.iii.org.tw/english/ III] and [http://www.tisc.org.tw/ ISC]. The [[Taiwan|OWASP Taiwan chapter]] hopes everything will turn out well for this event, and next year we can prepare much more in advance and have a separate vendors track.
