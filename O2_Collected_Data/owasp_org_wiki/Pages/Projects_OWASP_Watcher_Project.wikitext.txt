| project_description = 
Watcher is a runtime passive-analysis tool for HTTP-based Web applications. Being passive means it won't damage production systems, it's completely safe to use in Cloud computing, shared hosting, and dedicated hosting environments. Watcher detects Web-application security issues as well as operational configuration issues. Watcher provides pen-testers hot-spot detection for vulnerabilities, developers quick sanity checks, and auditors PCI compliance auditing. It looks for issues related to mashups, user-controlled payloads (potential XSS), cookies, comments, HTTP headers, SSL, Flash, Silverlight, referrer leaks, information disclosure, Unicode, and more.

'''Major Features:'''
* Passive detection of security, privacy, and PCI compliance issues in HTTP, HTML, Javascript, CSS, and development frameworks (e.g. ASP.NET, JavaServer);
* Works seamlessly with complex Web 2.0 applications while you drive the Web browser;
* Non-intrusive, will not raise alarms or damage production sites;
* Real-time analysis and reporting - findings are reported as theyâ€™re found, exportable to XML, HTML, and Team Foundation Server (TFS);
* Configurable domains with wildcard support;
* Extensible framework for adding new checks.
