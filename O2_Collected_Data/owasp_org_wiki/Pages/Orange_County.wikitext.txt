Abstract:
Jerry Hoff, the project leader of the OWASP Appsec Tutorial Series, and VP of the Static Code Analysis Division at WhiteHat Security, will be discussing his newest OWASP project, WebGoat.NET.  For many years, the Java version of WebGoat has been available as a fantastic tool for learning application security from the Java perspective.  Jerry has now created a parallel tool for ASP.NET developers to learn about application security.  Jerry will be discussing how this tool can be used in a learning environment, and other issues related to application security education.

8:15 - 8:30: Brakeman Demo


Brakeman with Justin Collins: 
While the popular Ruby on Rails web framework provides built-in protection 
for many security vulnerabilities, it is still possible to misuse these
features or introduce other vulnerabilities to an application. Brakeman is a static code analysis tool designed specifically to find vulnerabilities and configuration issues  in Ruby on Rails applications. Since it works at the source code level, Brakeman can be used at any point in development without the need for deploying the full application stack. To make it even simpler, 
Brakeman can be integrated with Hudson/Jenkins to provide automatic monitoring of Brakeman results as code is committed. This talk will discuss how to use Brakeman and how it can help you create safer Rails applications.

'''Edward Bonver'''
Talk Title:

Threat Modeling at Symantec
[[File:OWASP-WWW-2011-Edward-Bonver-Threat-Modelint-at-Symantec.pptx]]

Abstract:

Threat Modeling is one of the most important security activities that a development/QA team needs to perform as part of a Security Development Lifecycle. This activity allows the team to build a complete security profile of the system being built. Threat Modeling is not always easy to get going for a team that has little or no security experience. In this presentation we’ll take a look at why Threat Modeling is so important; we’ll explore the process behind it, and how the process is being implemented and followed across Symantec.

Bio:

Edward Bonver is a principal software engineer on the product security team under the Office of the CTO at Symantec Corporation.  In this capacity, Edward is responsible for working with software developers and quality assurance (QA) professionals across Symantec to continuously enhance the company’s software security practices through the adoption of methodologies, procedures and tools for secure coding and security testing.  Within Symantec, Edward teaches secure coding and security testing classes for Symantec engineers, and also leads the company’s QA Security Task Force, which he founded.  Prior to joining Symantec, Edward held software engineering and QA roles at Digital Equipment Corporation, Nbase and Zuma Networks.

Title: Do VLANs allow for good application security? 
 
Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) are not a new concept, and can help
any organization better control network access.  I will present some of
the previous issues identified, what was the root cause, and how these
have been fixed in current technology.  In addition we will talk about
how this can help to enhance security in your environment, and what
controls must be in place in order to implement such an environment.  We
will also touch on how this can complicate your application environment,
but improve overall security.

I will touch on the controls that need to be reviewed and audited when
working with VMware, VLANs, and web applications, to ensure that these
networks are secure, and what to look for to potentially pass audit
criteria.  I will also talk about where and how these controls have been
implemented in order to protect thousands of users while accessing one
of the most hostile networks in the world.

'''Abstract'''

'''Title: Pulling the Plug: Security Risks in the Next Generation of Offline Web Applications'''

As the line between desktop and web applications becomes increasingly blurry in a web 2.0 world, browser functionality is being pushed well beyond what it was originally intended for. Persistent client side storage has become a requirement for web applications if they are to be available both online and off. This need is being filled by a variety of technologies such as [http://webkit.org/blog/126/webkit-does-html5-client-side-database-storage Gears (formerly Google Gears) and the Database Storage]   functionality included in the emerging [http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html HTML 5 specification]. While all such technologies offer great promise, it is clear that the vast majority of developers simply do not understand their security implications.

Researching a variety of currently deployed implementations of these technologies has revealed a broad scope of vulnerabilities with frightening implications. Now attackers can target victims not just once, but every time they visit a site as the victim now carries and stores the attack with them. Imagine a scenario whereby updated confidential information is forwarded to an attacker every time a victim interacts with a given we application. The attacker no longer needs to worry about timing their attacks to ensure that the victim is authenticated as the victim attacks himself! Limited storage? Cookies that expire? Not a problem when entire databases are accessible with virtually unlimited storage and an infinite lifespan. Think these attacks are theoretical? Think again. In this talk we dive into these technologies and break down the risk posed by them when not properly understood. We will then detail a variety of real-world vulnerabilities that have been uncovered, including a new class of cross-site scripting and client-side SQL injection.
