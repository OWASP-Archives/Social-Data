| short_working_session_description= Consumers and organizations enlist the services of web-based services with no ability to make an informed decision on its security.  This can include enterprise class websites such as payment processing, HR portals, benefits administration, and other corporate services, as well as consumer centric websites such as tax preparation, personal finance, social media, or medical records.  While the companies providing these services are unlikely to share detailed information about known vulnerabilities in their systems, it would be beneficial to have a standardized mechanism for describing the security controls and processes in place.  In other words, what are they doing right that should give consumers some level of confidence that the provider exercises application security best practices?
