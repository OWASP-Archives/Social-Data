== Featured Item: 28,000 USD available for work selected OWASP Projects (July 2007 Batch) ==
Now with the SpoC 007 (Spring of Code 2007) under way, Dinis would like to ask for proposals for OWASP projects that OWASP has funds (28,000 USD) specifically allocated to:
* '''OSG - OWASP Site Generator''' -  Join Boris in his development of the new version of .NET's OSG (funds from SPI Dynamics and Cenzic membership fees) 
* '''OWASP Corporate Application Security Rating Guide''' - Create and release the first version of this very important document ( funds from Cenzic membership fees)
* '''Questions for SANS''' - Write 200 questions for SANS with a % of those questions made open to the OWASP community (funds directly allocated by SANS for this project)
* '''Source Code Review OWASP Projects''' - Implement a workflow where all OWASP projects that use JAVA technology are automatically audited for security flaws (funds directly allocated by Fortify Software for this project)
* '''BlackTop project''' - Develop a runtime code analysis tool to be used by Penetration Testers during client engagements (funds directly allocated by Ounce Labs for this project).
