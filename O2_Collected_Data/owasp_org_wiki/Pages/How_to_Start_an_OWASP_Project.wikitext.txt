== So you want to start a project... ==

Starting an OWASP Project is easy.  You don't have to be an application security expert.  You just have to have the drive and desire to make a contribution to the application security community.

Here are some of the guidelines for running a successful OWASP project:

* The best OWASP projects are strategic - they make it easier to produce secure applications by filling a gap in the application security knowledge-base or technology support.

* You ''can'' run a single person project, but it's usually best to get the community involved.  You should be prepared to support a mailing list, build a team, speak at conferences, and promote your project.

* You can contribute existing documents or tools to OWASP! Assuming you have the intellectual property rights to a work, you can open it to the world as an OWASP Project.  Please coordinate this with OWASP by contacting owasp(at)owasp.org.

* Available Grants to consider if you need funding - [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Grants Click Here]

* You should promote your project through the OWASP channels as well as by outside means.  Get people to blog about it!

== Creating a new project ==

[http://sl.owasp.org/new-project Here's the simple process for starting a new OWASP Project].
<br>
* Get the following information together:

A - PROJECT
# Project Name,
# Project purpose / overview,
# Project Roadmap,
# Project links (if any) to external sites,
# [http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Guidelines_for_OWASP_Projects#Project_Licensing Project License],
# Project Leader name,
# Project Leader email address,
# Project Leader wiki account - the username (you'll need this to edit the wiki),
# Project Contributor(s) (if any) - name email and wiki account (if any),
# Project Main Links (if any).
<br>
*As your project reaches a point that you'd like OWASP to assist in its promotion, the [[Global Projects Committee|OWASP Global Projects Committee]]  will need the following to help spread the word about your project:

# [http://globalprojectscommittee.wordpress.com/2009/07/27/what-is-the-3x-slide-presentation-thing/ Conference style presentation that describes the tool/document in at least 3 slides],
# [http://globalprojectscommittee.wordpress.com/2009/07/21/what-is-this-project-flyerpamphlet-thing/ Project Flyer/Pamphlet (PDF file)],
<br>
* If possible, get also the following information together:

B â€“ FIRST RELEASE
# Release Name,
# Release Description,
# Release Downloadable file link 
# Release Leader,
# Release Contributor(s),
# Release Reviewer,
# Release Sponsor(s) (if any),
# Release Notes
# Release Main Links (if any),
<br>
* Note: For Project/Release Leader, Contributors and Reviewers please create a [[Special:RequestAccount|wiki accounts]] and please send the links off. See [[Tutorial]] and [[:User:Mtesauro|here]] how to do it and [[:Category:OWASP Live CD Project|here]] an example of how it will be used.
<br>
* To get your project started, fill out the [http://sl.owasp.org/new-project new project form].  We'll review the information and get you set up with a project wiki page, a mailing list, and subscribe you to the OWASP-Leaders list. You'll be part of setting OWASP's direction!
