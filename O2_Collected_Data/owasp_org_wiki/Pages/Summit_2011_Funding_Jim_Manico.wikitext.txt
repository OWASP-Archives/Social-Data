I've donated a great deal of my time to OWASP over the last several years. But what really stands out in my mind is how OWASP has given me so much more in return.

Through OWASP email lists and conferences, I've had the chance to interact with some of the brightest minds in the world of web application security. 

Through OWASP guides and standards, I've had the chance to gain a deep understanding of the threats that face todays web applications.

Through OWASP software libraries and other tools, I've had the chance to hone my skills as a developer of secure web applications.

When you sponsor an OWASP leader to attend an OWASP working summit, you do more than help that one individual. Sponsoring an OWASP summit attendee has a ripple effect that benefits the 10's of thousands of developers and security professionals who utilize OWASP resources to reduce application risk on a global scale. 

My OWASP affiliation over the past several years has been a gift, one that I am very grateful for.
