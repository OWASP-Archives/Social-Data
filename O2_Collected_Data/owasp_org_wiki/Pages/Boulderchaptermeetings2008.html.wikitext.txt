=== Aug 2008 '''''Static Analysis Techniques for Testing Application Security'' (Dan Cornell of The Denim Group)''' ===
Static Analysis of software refers to examining source code and other software artifacts without executing them. This presentation looks at how these techniques can be used to identify security defects in applications. Approaches examined will range from simple keyword search methods used to identify calls to banned functions through more sophisticated data flow analysis used to identify more complicated issues such as injection flaws. In addition, a demonstration will be given of two freely-available static analysis tools: FindBugs for the Java platform and FXCop for the .NET platform. Finally, some approaches will be presented on how organizations can start using static analysis tools as part of their development and quality assurance processes.

'''Dan Cornell''' has over ten years of experience architecting and developing web-based software systems. He leads Denim Group’s security research team in investigating the application of secure coding and development techniques to improve web-based software development methodologies.

Dan was the founding coordinator and chairman for the Java Users Group of San Antonio (JUGSA) and is currently the San Antonio chapter leader of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). He is a recognized expert in the area of web application security for SearchSoftwareQuality.com and the primary author of [http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Sprajax_Project Sprajax], OWASP’s open source tool for assessing the security of AJAX-enabled web applications.

=== '''''May 2008 Meeting Notes - David C Campbell and Eric Duprey - Cross Site Scripting, Exploits and Defenses ===

Topic: Cross Site Scripting, Exploits and Defenses
Sponsor: [http://www.fishnetsecurity.com/ FishNet Security]

For a long time, the impact of XSS vulnerabilities has been grossly underestimated. Recent compromises, such as the pro-Hillary [http://cyberinsecure.com/hacked-obama-site-redirects-visitors-to-clintons-site/ defacement] of Barack Obama's website demonstrated the impact of XSS vulnerabilities to the masses.
During this presentation, we demonstrated exactly how effective XSS vulns can be, and showed you what you can do to protect yourself and your sites.
The practicalities of doing live-demos meant that each night we had one demo fail. At Denver it was the live session stealing demo against a production website. In Boulder it was the browser-based botnet.
Nevertheless, we hope that you found the presentations interesting, and the interactive format a welcome change.

=== '''''April 2008 Meeting Notes - Ryan C. Barnett - Dynamic Vulnerability Identification: Continuous Web Application Assessment''''' ===

The sponsor was Breach Security, and the speaker was Ryan C. Barnett of Breach Security.  Ryan demonstrated the concept of using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) as a means of detecting vulnerabilities.

Ryan's presentation is available in PDF format [https://www.owasp.org/images/f/fd/OWASP_Dynamic_Vulnerability_Identification_RyanBarnett200804.pdf  here.]

Identifying web application vulnerabilities has traditionally been achieved by running vulnerability scanners. While these tools can been effective, they have some deficiencies, mainly that they are simply snap-shots in time and they often add network load on the web application. Web application firewalls can help to detect application defects in applications by monitoring the application as it is used. In this presentation, Ryan Barnett, Director of Application Security at Breach, will discuss how deploying a web application firewall can provide more value beyond simply protecting applications from attack. Due to their strategic placement within the application's communication stream, web application firewalls, can provide a great deal of visibility into how an application is used and detect defects by watching the interaction between the application and a client.

Ryan C. Barnett is a recognized security thought leader and evangelist who frequently speaks with the media and industry groups.
He is the director of application security at Breach Security. He is also a faculty member for the SANS Institute, where his duties include instructor/courseware developer for Apache Security/Building a Web Application Firewall Workshop, Top 20 Vulnerabilities Team Member and Local Mentor for the SANS Track 4, "Hacker Techniques, Exploits and Incident Handling" course. He holds six SANS Global Information Assurance Certifications (GIAC): Intrusion Analyst (GCIA), Systems and Network Auditor (GSNA), Forensic Analyst (GCFA), Incident Handler (GCIH), Unix Security Administrator (GCUX) and Security Essentials (GSEC).
Mr. Barnett also serves as the team lead for the Center for Internet Security Apache Benchmark Project and is a member of the Web Application Security Consortium. His web security book, [http://www.amazon.com/Preventing-Attacks-Apache-Ryan-Barnett/dp/0321321286 "Preventing Web Attacks with Apache,”] was published by Addison/Wesley in 2006.

=== '''''February 2008 Meeting Notes - Michael Sutton - SQL Injection''''' ===
