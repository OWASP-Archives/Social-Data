==Goals==
The OWASP PHP Project's overall goal is to...

 Produce materials that show PHP developers, application architects, and 
 systems administrators how to deal with most common application security
 problems throughout the complete lifecycle of the application.

In the near term, we are focused on the following tactical goals:

# Implementing Security using Best Practices (Non Framework Based Applications)
# Provide examples of how to prevent Cross Site Scripting attacks in popular web frameworks
# Provide examples of how to prevent SQL Injection in popular data access frameworks
# Provide examples of how to prevent Cross Site Scripting attacks in popular AJAX frameworks 
# Provide examples of how to prevent LDAP injection in PHP
# Secure configuration guides

==Current Tasks==

* Call for volunteers - Join the [http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-phpness mailing list], read the [[Tutorial]] and get started!
