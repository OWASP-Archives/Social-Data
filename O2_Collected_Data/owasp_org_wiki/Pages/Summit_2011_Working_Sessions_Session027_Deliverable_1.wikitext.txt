== '''Deliverable 1''' ==

'''Increase coverage and functionality of existing Output Encoding Codecs''' 

# Ensure that existing codecs are working to specification for their context and cover all escaping and encoding rules for that context
## Are there any new escaping rules for HTML5, ES5, or CSS3 that are not addressed by the current codecs?
## Can we improve the MySQL Codec to account for additional modes of operation?
## Is documentation on these codecs and when/where they should be used sufficient?
