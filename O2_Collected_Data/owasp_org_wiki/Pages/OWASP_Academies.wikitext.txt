==== OWASP Academies meeting - 5th, 6th January ====

== Preparatory meeting for the Summit'11 ==

Following the email sent in October regarding the OWASP Academies and the work OWASP is developing to implement and operationalize this concept, multiple feedback and contributions for the discussion have been received.


We thought that one way to turn the feedback and interest received into something positive and constructive would be to sit the people involved at a table and discuss experiences, views and ideas for the OWASP Academies' operational model. Knowing, for example, how the already established connections with Universities were started and how they are working, what would seem to these partners the most reasonable “next step” in terms of formalization or knowing what, from the Universities’ point of view, would be an interesting model of relationship, could be of great use for our own definition and consolidation of the OWASP Academies concept.


In this context, '''a meeting will be held on the 5th and 6th of January, in Lisbon,''' with the following format:
 
* Two days (5th and 6th January) of '''working sessions focused on the OWASP Academies''' where the operational model will be discussed with the intent to prepare a draft that can be presented and debated in the Summit'11 to happen in February;
* Main objectives should be:
** Definition of the concept behind the OWASP Academy model;
** Discussion of Certification;
** Identification of a "to do" list for the Summit'11.


The meetings will take place at [http://www.iscte.pt/ ISCTE, Lisbon University Institute], in Lisbon. 
Address is Av.ª das Forças Armadas, 1649-026 LISBOA.


Unfortunately, due to budgetary constraints, it will not be possible for us to invite all who have contributed for the discussion and pay for their traveling and accommodation. We have therefore devised a criteria of selection for paid invitations that takes into account both the level of engagement in the discussion and the amount of work already done within the Academic community.


Having said that, if you find sponsorship to fund your trip and stay in Lisbon, you will be very welcome to join us – just drop [mailto:sandra.paiva@owasp.org me] a line to let me know you are coming!

==== Conclusions of the Meeting ====

'''Following two days of intense and animated debate''' about what would be the best model to support the OWASP Academies, '''the team gathered in Lisbon has reached the following results:'''

* The OWASP Academies will be embodied by the '''OAP (OWASP Academic Portal)'''
<br>
* The '''OAP''' will be an online platform, mainly aimed at professors and students, comprised by 3 distinct components

** '''Blocks''' – sets of teachable contents formatted for diverse purposes and ready to use

** '''Labs''' – platforms with vulnerable apps and hands-on exercises

** '''Community''' – where interaction platforms, foruns and tools facilitating asynchronous communication will be made available
<br>
* It has been decided that an OWASP Project would be created to support this area of work – [[OWASP Academy Portal Project|OWASP Academy Portal Project]] 
<br>
* The OPA will be led by [[user:Knoblochmartin|Martin Knobloch]], Ricardo Melo and [[user:Conpap|Konstantinos Papapanagiotou]] and will have the following contributors: Vasileos Vlachos, Jim Burkman, Andreas Fuchsberger, Jason Taylor, [[User:Pontocom|Carlos Serrão]], Filipe Lacerda, Ed Adams, [[user:Dinis.cruz|Dinis Cruz]]
<br>
* Filipe Lacerda accepted the responsibility of hosting the 1st version of the OWASP Academies Portal and Vasileos and Kostas will ensure the hosting of the Labs of the Portal
<br>
* Security Innovation has agreed to sponsor this Project by providing a hosting environment that allows SCORM eLearning content, forums, glossary, resources (such as zip, word, pdf, etc) and tracking and reporting features
<br>
* It has been agreed that the 1st version of the OAP will be presented at the Summit'11
<br>

== UPDATE - 11 Jan 2011 ==

We would like to inform that, within the context of the Academies meeting and what has there been discussed, [[User:Pontocom|Carlos Serrão]] (Portuguese Chapter Leader and Assistant Professor at ISCTE - Instituto Universitário) has informed us of ISCTE's interest in discussing the idea of creating a Summer Course on the AppSec area.

Following a more detailed conversation with Carlos and a subsequent discussion with [[user:Dinis.cruz|Dinis Cruz (OWASP Board)]], it has been decided that [[user:Sandra Paiva|Sandra Paiva]], [[user:Paulo Coimbra|Paulo Coimbra]] and [[User:Pontocom|Carlos Serrão]] would draft a plan for the creation of a Summer School.
