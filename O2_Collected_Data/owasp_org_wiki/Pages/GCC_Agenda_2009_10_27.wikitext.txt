* Call for mentors (Seba)
*Chapter success criteria / goals: 
** # meetings 
** # people in mailing list
** # people attending meetings
** # active board members
** membership drive: # owasp supporters - membership - sponsors
** # media attentation: how to measure? e.g. news.google.com
** participating in other events
** providing awareness at local schools & universities
** I18N, translations...
** involvement in projects and committees
=> this should be seen as guidance: chapters are different all over the world
=> we should talk about guidelines and minimal criteria
=> avoid 'succes criteria', see these as goals
* in general the wiki should be used as placeholder for chapter activity - for reasons of openess, licensing and in general making it easy for people to find their local chapter. Exceptions are acceptable for I18N issues.
