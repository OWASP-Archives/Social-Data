'''Q. Is there an honorarium for presenters?'''

No.  OWASP is committed to making its conferences available to the widest possible audience.  In order to do this OWASP keeps the entrance free for the AppSec Brazil 2009 to make the conference accessible.  As a result we are unable to provide a monetary honorarium but we welcome our speakers as our guests to the conference where they can network with other security professionals. We will provide lodging and domestic air travel for one presenter for each selected work.
