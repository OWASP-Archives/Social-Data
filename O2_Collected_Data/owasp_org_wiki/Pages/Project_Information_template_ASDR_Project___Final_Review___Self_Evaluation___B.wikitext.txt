1. At what extent have the project deliveries & objectives been accomplished?  Having in consideration [[OWASP Summer of Code 2008 Applications#The Application Security Desk Reference - ASDR|'''the assumed ones''']], please exemplify writing down those of them that haven't been realised.

2. At what extent have the project deliveries & objectives been accomplished?  Having in consideration [[OWASP Summer of Code 2008 Applications#The Application Security Desk Reference - ASDR|'''the assumed ones''']], please quantify in terms of percentage.
 | colspan="2" style="width:75%; background:#cccccc" align="left"|Except by articles development/review and considering all the work (templates definition, 2 new categories created, draft book compilation, definition of subcategories for each category in order to define a taxonomy) and despite my underestimation of work when I applied to SoC, I believe the project reached 80%.

Also, another task that wasn't defined in the proposal was made. All articles (+600) were filtered out and merged when suitable, thus making 303 articles tagged to be deleted.
The current number of articles in ASDR is 357, which already had been put in template structure.
