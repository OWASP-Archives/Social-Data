== Abstract: Baking It In: Abuse-Resistant Web Applications == 

Current solutions for securing Web applications at run-time rely heavily on signatures to identify and respond to threats. But signatures have become less effective at detecting threats over time, and aren’t sufficient to address the sophisticated abusive behavior that large, publicly exposed Web applications are subject to, including page scraping, logic abuse, malicious automation, phishing, and malware distribution. 

<br>The key shortcoming is a lack of application context – without any grounding in actual application and user behavior, signature-based solutions can’t avoid flagging many false positives. This makes the information they provide to administrators practically un-actionable. 

<br>In response, new approaches are emerging that focus on behavior, not input signatures. One key trend is to enhance the application code itself with detection points that provide more transparency into malicious user behavior. This enables administrators to prevent application abuse before bad users can establish an attack vector. In this presentation, we’ll discuss the merits and challenges of this approach. We’ll focus on specific examples, including the OWASP AppSensor project and the Mykonos Security Appliance.<br>

[http://Www.MykonosSoftware.com '''Mykonos Software'''] approaches Web application security differently. We understand how Web applications are abused by criminal attackers to steal data, commit fraud, or use company IP for un-intended tasks.<br> 

The Mykonos Security Appliance detects malicious abuse of web applications before the damage is done. This software solution profiles the abuse through intelligence gathering and responds to any abuse in real-time ultimately preventing data theft, fraudulent behavior and misuse of your Web properties. <br>
