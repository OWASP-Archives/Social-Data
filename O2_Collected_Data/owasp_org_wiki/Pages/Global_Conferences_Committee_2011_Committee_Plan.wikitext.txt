| 1
| 1, 3
| Develop a system to take in applications for all non-chapter meeting events, vet them, and schedule them.  This system shall serve as the "official" registration path for all events and allow the GCC to get a firm grip on the OWASP Event Calendar.

| OWASP Global Conference Sponsors
| 2
| 3, 7
| Provide unified sponsorship mechanism for all Global AppSec conferences.  This will help us plan our conference revenue annually and help sponsors plan for their spending (identified as an issue by several vendors).  This is intended to augment, not replace individual conference sponsorships.

| OWASP AppSec Track
| 3
| 2
| Joint venture with the GPC.  The track would consist of a cadre (10-20) of speakers from inew/high profile OWASP projects.  The GCC would manage these speakers through an internal call for papers that would be vetted by the GCC/GPC for some of our best speakers from high profile projects.  As a new conference requests an OWASP Speaking track (or for Global AppSec conferences, this will be required) the GCC would reach out to the selected presenters to verify their availability for the event and provide a list of 6-7 speakers to the local event coordinators for the schedule.
| Planning for AppSecUSA release in Sept.
