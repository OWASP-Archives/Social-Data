== Local News  ==

It’s been a while!  We hope that all of you had a wonderful time with family and friends over the Christmas/New Year break, and we're sure that you’re all ready for more OWASP geekiness.
 
We do have a few exciting announcements...
 
Firstly, we would like to welcome David Jorm to the chapter leader’s team.  As most of you are aware, David’s been helping us behind the scenes with organising the meetings for a while and has become an integral part of the team.  We would like to thank him for his efforts and look forward to building the chapter as a team this year. 

For those that aren’t aware, there is an OWASP Appsec Asia Pacific Conference this year held in Sydney from 11-14 April.  Justin Derry, as the co-chair of the planning committee, will tell us about all the cool stuff planned for the conference and what’s happening in OWASP Australia in April’s meeting.  

For more details on the conference, go to https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSecAsiaPac2012.

==== Presenters and Presentations ====
Now that all the announcements are done – we would like to ask for your help.  We are forever looking for volunteers to present at the chapter meetings, so if you've seen something interesting or you have something to say, please let us know.

Often, when we approach potential presenters, we tend to get the following response – “I don’t think my topic is interesting enough”.  We just want to stress that as long as the topic is security related – we’re all ears!  We’re just a bunch of nice people wanting to learn/share our knowledge of the security domain.  So if you would like to present or know of someone that does, please contact us.

Presentations must be vendor agnostic (no selling of products or services), and please review the Speaker Agreement linked above.

== Chapter Meetings  ==

''Next Brisbane Chapter Meeting - Tuesday 3rd April'' 

In April's OWASP Brisbane Chapter meeting, Paul Ducklin will present a session titled "Search Engine Poisoning". Last time Paul presented the seats were fully booked out within a week. If you don't want to miss out this time around be sure to RSVP below.

Find out how search engine poisoning works, and why it's not just lazy or gullible users who fall for online scams such as fake anti-virus software. This live demo will give you a quick "look behind the scenes" at how cybercrooks use legitimate websites to help them trick the major search engines and peddle their scareware.

Paul Ducklin has the grandiose job title of "Head of Technology, Asia Pacific" at Sophos. But don't let that put you off. Paul is one of the world's leading security experts, and loves to share his knowledge. He is an entertaining and sought-after presenter world-wide. In 2009, he won the inaugural AusCERT Director's Award for Individual Excellence in Information Security.

''Venue'': Red Hat, Level 1, 193 North Quay, Brisbane.

''Time'': 5:30pm for a 6pm start. '''Access to the buliding will be restricted after 6pm. Please arrive before then!'''

''Close'': Session is expected to be completed by 7:30pm. 

''RSVP'': Online at http://owasp-brisbane.eventbrite.com

There will be a social gathering at a local hostelry afterwards. Everyone is welcome to attend!
