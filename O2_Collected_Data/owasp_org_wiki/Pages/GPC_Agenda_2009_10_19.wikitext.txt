== From Previous Meeting/Follow up  ==

*[[:Summit 2009|"OWASP Mini-Summit 2009"]]/[[:OWASP AppSec DC 2009]]: 
**[https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/present/edit?id=0Ae9M2vJFBkqfZGZjOGJoY3dfMmM3cHI0OGN6&hl=en Brad's PPT]. 
**[[:File:AppSec DC 2009 OWASP GPC.ppt|Brad's PPT - Second version]]
***Issues (revision)we decided last meeting to add to the PPT:
****One slide about review process,
****A reviewers' drive, 
****What we ask to all projects
****Maybe a PDF with all diagrams and processes/everything we have, 
****What we want from our community,
****SoC, 
****We should use a methodology similar to [[OWASP Working Session Top 10 2009|the one we used in the former Summit]], 
****Projects committee should involve the community in determining which projects/project leaders are supported financially. Travel, evangelism, publication, training, etc..... 

----

*Honorary memberships to be given to "active" OWASP participants (chapter leader, project participants, etc.). Chapter and projects committees to submit proposal for persons to be given membership: 
**Community's adhesion has been very limited if any - See the [[OWASP Projects Dashboard|"OWASP Projects Dashboard"]],
**It seems we haven't been clear and confused project leaders with the distinction between "contributors" and ""past_leaders_special_contributions" - Action must be taken.  
** We need to add a column in the [[OWASP Projects Dashboard|"OWASP Projects Dashboard"]] to show "current" contributors.

----

*Spreading [[:Template:OWASP Project Identification Tab|OWASP Project Details Tab]] through [[OWASP Projects Dashboard|ALL OWASP Projects]]. 
*Waiting until we (Jason's task?) come up with revised&improved wiki code to either link project with release and to consider the below referred, 
**Consider having a single release roadmap page that is not attached to a single version but instead is the summation of the various release roadmaps.
***The single page is easier for project leaders to find/edit
***The single page would show the progression of the project to external audiences
***Makes the release roadmap very similar to a changelog - which is more useful if its in one place rather then in bits attached to releases.

----

*Committee members' evaluation process. 
**"GPC - Send 'Individual Committee Member' [https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=ckdDbXE0bkxPM3dkbDZvSmFNWVBGcnc6MA online form]".
