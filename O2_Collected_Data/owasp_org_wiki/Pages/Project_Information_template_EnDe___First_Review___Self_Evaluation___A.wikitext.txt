1. At what extent have the project deliveries & objectives been accomplished?  Having in consideration [[:Category:OWASP EnDe RoadMap|'''the assumed ones''']], please exemplify writing down those of them that haven't been realised.

The current version is stable (beside some known browser GUI quirks). There're improvements planed like adding more hashing, coding and encryption functions, see [[:Category:OWASP EnDe RoadMap| EnDe RoadMap]] for details. This new functionality should be considered as enhancement request.

2. At what extent have the project deliveries & objectives been accomplished?  Having in consideration [[:Category:OWASP EnDe RoadMap|'''the assumed ones''']], please quantify in terms of percentage.
 | colspan="2" style="width:75%; background:#cccccc" align="left"|
As the above listed encryption functions are more difficult to implement than those already there, I'd calculate the project at 75%.<br>
Integration with other tools - 0%

1. Reviewer
* anything to be found at the OWASP wiki
* the documentation, see <nowiki>[?]</nowiki> button in the GUI and EnDe.man.txt
2. Community
* initial code for the missing features (see [[:Category:OWASP EnDe RoadMap| EnDe RoadMap]])

* (Agree to OWASP's open source license): ''pending'', currently GPL2 will probably become CC-x.x
* (The “main” page for any OWASP tool must be on the OWASP website)
