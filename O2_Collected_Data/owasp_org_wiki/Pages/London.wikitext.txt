====Talks====
*'''Top 10 Web Defences - Jim Manico''' ([[Media:Developer Top Ten Core Controls v4.2.pptx|PPTX]])
*:We cannot hack or firewall our way secure. Application programmers need to learn to code in a secure fashion if we have any chance of providing organisations with proper defences in the current threatscape. This talk will discuss the 10 most important security-centric computer programming techniques necessary to build low-risk web based applications.
*'''IronWASP - Manish Saindane''' ([[Media:IronWASP.pptx|PPTX]])
*:IronWASP (Iron Web application Advanced Security testing Platform) is an open source system for web application vulnerability testing. It is designed to be customizable to the extent where users can create their own custom security scanners using it. Though an advanced user with Python/Ruby scripting expertise would be able to make full use of the platform, a lot of the tool's features are simple enough to be used by absolute beginners.

*''Implementing cryptography: good theory vs. bad practice - Viet Pham ([[https://www.owasp.org/images/c/c5/OwaspTalkMarch.pdf PDF]])
:Abstract: Cryptography is being widely implemented in software to provide security features. The main reason is that, many cryptographic mechanisms are mathematically proven secure, or trusted secure given some mathematical reasoning. However, to take full advantages of these mechanisms, they must be implemented strictly according to the theoretical models, e.g., several cryptographic mechanisms must be used together, in a specific manner to provide a desired security goal. However, without strong cryptographic background, many software developers tend to deviate from these models, thus making their own security software a gold mine for attackers. This talk gives examples to show why such situations exist, where do they spread, and how bad they may turn into.

*''Securing the SSL channel against man-in-the-middle attacks: Future technologies - HTTP Strict Transport Security and and Pinning of Certs - Tobias Gondrom ([[http://www.gondrom.org/owasp/presentations/OWASP_defending-MITMA_RHUL.pdf PDF]])
:"In the recent months major trusted CAs providing trusted certificates for SSL/TLS in browser scenarios were compromised (e.g. seen in the Diginotar breach) and based on the current trust models (trusting all registered CAs equally for all domains) exposed vital web applications to the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks. Several approaches are currently discussed to mitigate this risk. The most advanced and closest to final adoption being the technologies discussed by the browser vendors at the recent IETF meeting in November in Taipei: HSTS and pinning of certificates. To better protect content providers against the distribution of bogus certificates, an HTTP header extension containing a fingerprint of their certificates linked to a domain address has been defined. This approach, which has been partly tested in Chrome, and already helped identify and protect to some extend Google's web application in the recent Diginotar compromise. Chrome users were able to detect the bogus DigiNotar certificates because Chrome had embedded the hashes of valid Google certificates. Back in July, the hacked DigiNotar certificate authority (CA), which has since gone out of business, was used to issue more than five hundred bogus certificates for companies including Google and various intelligence services."
