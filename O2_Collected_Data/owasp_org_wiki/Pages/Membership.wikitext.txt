= OWASP Membership Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  =

== My organization is not in a position to contribute monetarily, but we would like to contribute technical services. Is there a way for us to be involved?  ==

Technology Supporter designations are available for organizations who make valuable in-kind donations of technology support services. Please contact your local Chapter Leader if you would like to become a Chapter Supporter in this manner or contact the Global Membership Committee if you would like to become an Organizational Supporter.

== I’m an active (chapter leader, project leader, committee member). Does that mean I’m an OWASP Honorary Member and get to vote?  ==

== My organization supports OWASP, but the $5,000 USD as a donation per year to become a Global Supporter is too expensive. What options are available?  ==

A great way to participate in OWASP is to support your local chapter. Please look into becoming a Chapter Supporter at the level where you feel comfortable.

== Why Should I Become An OWASP Member or Organization Supporter  ==

OWASP provides documentation, tools, methodologies, standards, articles, and message forums (“OWASP Materials”) as a service to Internet users worldwide to help users and developers understand more about application security.

In addition to the benefits you receive as described above, your membership helps to support the growth of OWASP and the development of new and improved OWASP Materials.

Your support will help OWASP continue to find and fight the causes of insecure software.
