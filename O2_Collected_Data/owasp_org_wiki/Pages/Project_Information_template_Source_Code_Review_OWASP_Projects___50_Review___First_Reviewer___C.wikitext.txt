#With regard to the "Preliminary Workflow", it may be possible to simplify the workflow by taking out the "Is it a fixed version?" decision-point and configuring all projects as "continuous build". That may also allow a project to be re-started in the future without having to create a new project. It seems like this is more likely to happen with an open source project.
