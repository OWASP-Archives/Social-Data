=== Overview  ===

This project's goal is to create a "best practices" web application penetration testing framework which users can implement in their own organizations and a "low level" web application penetration testing guide that describes how to find certain issues. 

Version 3 of the Testing Guide was released in December 2008 after going through a major upgrade through the [[OWASP Summer of Code 2008]]. 

=== Background and Motivation  ===

'''History Behind Project''' The OWASP Testing guide originated in 2003 with Dan Cuthbert as one of the original editors. It was handed over to [[User:EoinKeary|Eoin Keary]] in 2005 and moved onto the new OWASP wiki when it came online. Being in a wiki is easier for people to contribute and has made updating much easier. [[User:Mmeucci|Matteo Meucci]] took on the Testing guide after Eoin and shepherded it through the version 2 and version 3 updates, which have been significant improvements.
