== Web 2.0 Security ==

=== Summary ===
This class will cover common RIA security threats and vulnerabilities and it will provide specific guidance on how to develop RIA to defend against these threats and vulnerabilities. Training developers on secure coding practices offers one of highest returns on investment of any security investment by eliminating vulnerabilities at the source. Aspect's Building Secure RIA Course is designed to enable developers to use RIA technologies in their web applications without introducing security issues. The course provides detailed examples of 'what to do' and 'what not to do.' The course will use demonstrations, code examples, and spot-the-bug exercises to get developers engaged in the topic. Developers will leave with an understanding of how RIA attacks work, the impacts of successful attacks, and what to do to defend against them.

=== Course Overview ===
The course begins with an overview and a Web 2.0 introduction. The next section deals with exploring the AJAX and RIA surface attacks, followed by Authentication and Session control sections. Cross Site Request Forgery, Cross Site Scripting and Protecting Sensitive Data, are the next sections which are followed by Error Handling and Logging and References to round out the class.

=== Requirements ===
If you are interested in participating in the hands on portion of the course, please bring a Wi-Fi enabled Windows based laptop.
