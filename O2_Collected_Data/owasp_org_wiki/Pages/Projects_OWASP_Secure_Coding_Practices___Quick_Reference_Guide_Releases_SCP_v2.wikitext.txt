*Now available in Portuguese: [http://www.owasp.org/images/d/d8/OWASP_SCP_Quick_Reference_PT-BR_v1.1.pdf Updated Portuguese Version PDF]

*Sections of the guide were re-ordered, renamed and new sections were added to map more closely to the ASVS. However input and output handling was left at the beginning, as apposed to be lower in the list as it is with ASVS, since this is the source of the most common vulnerabilities and ones that effect even very simple applications. 
*Entirely new sections include:
**Cryptographic Practices,
**Error Handling and Logging".  
*The guide's "Data Validation" section was split to match ASVS and is now represented as two separate sections "Input Validation" and "Output Encoding",
*The guide's "Authorization and Access Management" section was renamed to Access Control,  
*The guide's "Sensitive Information Storage or Transmission" section was split to match ASVS and is now two new sections "Data Protection" and "Communication Security",  
*Additional practices were added to most sections to account for requirements in ASVS that the guide did not specifically cover and some rewording of existing practices was also done.
*Additional terms were added to the glossary.
*Several improvements were made thanks to new contributors.
