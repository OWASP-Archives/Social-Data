==Description==

Attack surface area and simplicity go hand in hand. Certain software engineering fads prefer overly complex approaches to what would otherwise be relatively straightforward and simple code. Developers should avoid the use of double negatives and complex architectures when a simpler approach would be faster and simpler. 


==Examples==

===Entity Beans vs. Global Variables===
:Although it might be fashionable to have a slew of singleton entity beans running on a separate middleware server, it is more secure and faster to simply use global variables with an appropriate mutex mechanism to protect against race conditions.
