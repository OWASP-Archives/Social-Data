# Coordination
## assign a coordinator for the translation of each document
## use the wiki to assign and control the translation of pages/sections/chapters/etc.
## use the mailing list so people know the activities being worked on.
# Defined process
## split documents in smaller chunks
## allocate chunks to translators
## verify how the work is going, ask for deadlines
## maintain a waiting list of volunteers so we can re-assign chunks if needed
## translation reviews must be done by a person from a country different from the translator
