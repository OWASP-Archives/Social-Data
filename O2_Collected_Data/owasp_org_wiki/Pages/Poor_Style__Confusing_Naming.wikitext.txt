==Description==

The class contains a field and a method with the same name.

It is confusing to have a member field and a method with the same name. It makes it easy for a programmer to accidentally call the method when attempting to access the field or vice versa.

==Risk Factors==

==Examples==

<pre>
public class Totaller {
	  private int total;
	  public int total() {
		...
	  }
	}
</pre>
