{{Template:Project About | project_name =OWASP File Hash Repository | project_home_page = OWASP_File_Hash_Repository | project_description =The goal of this project is to build a repository of hashes of executable and source files. This repository can then be queried by clients to determine the status os of files based on their hashes. Some statuses are GOOD, MALWARE, SOURCE CHECKED, etc. This repository can consolidate several available sources (NIST, MHR, VirusTotal, etc) and provide better query capabilities. | project_license =Apache 2.0 License | leader_name1 =Lucas C.
