Ivan is the co-founder and CEO of Compass Security AG, a Swiss pen-testing and web hacking firm. He is lecturing both at the University of Applied Science Lucerne and Rapperswil about Ethical Hacking and Web Security. Ivan is the founder of Hacking-Lab - a very interactive remote security lab which is the core for wargame challenges or CTF's. He is the author of mod_but Apache module that will enable pre-auth, session hiding and advanced web entry functionality. Ivan is an active member in multiple foundations and always open to learn and share. I am attending the OWASP Summit 2011 discuss a collaboration between OWASP and Hacking-Lab and how we could setup a free OWASP TOP 10 training. I live in Switzerland, married with my lovely wife; we have two boys (2000,2002) and I am beginner guitar player. I like traveling, table-tennis, mountain biking, climbing and not to forget having a lazy time in a cozy ambiance.
