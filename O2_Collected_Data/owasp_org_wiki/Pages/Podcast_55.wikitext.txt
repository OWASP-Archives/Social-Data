This podcast is based on the blog post "Overcoming Objections to an Application Security Program" by Jeremiah Grossman at [http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2009/08/overcoming-objections-to-application.html http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2009/08/overcoming-objections-to-application.html]

<ul>
<li>"There have been no security problems in the past, nor is there any evidence weâ€™ll be attacked in the future."</li>
<li>"Security is an IT problem. They have firewalls, patch & configuration management systems, and SSL currently in place protecting us."</li>
<li>"We need new features first and there is no discretionary budget left to allocate towards security."</li>
<li>"Hackers can't break in because our Web application can't be accessed externally."</li>
<li>"We outsource our software development and the vendor is responsible for making sure the code is secure."</li>
<li>"We use penetration-testing services. We fix or accept the risk of any issues found, which keeps us safe."</li>
<li>"We passed our most recent compliance audit and not required to do anything more."</li>
<li>"We trust our developers and they already know how to develop secure code after completing the training course."</li>
<li>"We already have scanning tools. Doing more will slow down the development process, inhibit innovation, and add large unnecessary costs."</li>
</ul>
