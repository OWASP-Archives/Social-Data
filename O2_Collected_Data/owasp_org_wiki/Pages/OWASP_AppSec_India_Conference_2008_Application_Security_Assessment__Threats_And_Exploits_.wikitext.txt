== Application Security Assessment (Threats and Exploits) ==
As a corporate, you may already have various security solutions in place like firewalls, IDS etc. to defend corporate assets, but access to port http(80) and https(443) is still allowed all the time. This is the layer where applications are running and where attackers are looking for possible vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access. Published research and surveys suggest that 7 out of every 10 sites are vulnerable to various application layer attack vectors. Over 70% of cyber attacks target web ports and that is where strong security measures are required and best way to start is to have strong knowledge base around security issues, strategies and defense tactics. 

This workshop is designed by the author of "Web Hacking: Attacks and Defense", “Hacking Web Services” and “Web 2.0 Security – Defending Ajax, RIA and SOA” bringing his experience in application security and research as part of curriculum to address new challenges. The class features real life cases, hands one exercises, new scanning tools and defense mechanisms. Participants would be methodically exposed to various different attack vectors and exploits. In the class instructor will explain new tools like wsScanner, scanweb2.0, AppMap, AppCodeScan etc. for better pen-testing and application audits. Below is a list of topics those will be covered in this workshop:

* Application Security Fundamentals and Principles
* Application Components and Protocols
* Application footprinting and discovery
* Application Attack countermeasures
* Assessment methods
* Reconnaissance and Vulnerability Assessment
* Fuzzing and Exploitation
* Web Services attacks
* Forcing application layer errors
* Information leakage through error messages
* Source code disclosure
* Input tampering and input validation attacks
* SQL injection and attacks on the database
* Injecting malicious code and remote command execution
* Accessing the underlying file system
* Brute forcing HTTP authentication
* Brute forcing HTML form authentication
* Session Hijacking
* Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks
* Cross Site Request Forgery (XSRF) attacks
* XPATH injection
* XML and Schema poisoning
* Blind SQL injection
* XSS proxy attacks
* Browser hijacking
* Intranet scanning
* Javascript exploitation
