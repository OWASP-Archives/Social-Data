==Description==

Output validation refers to the process of validating the output of a process before it is sent to some recepient. For example, if you search your output for credit card numbers and replace them with asterisks (*), you have validated the output before sending it.  You might also validate the output for common attacks, such as [[Cross-site Scripting (XSS)]] and [[SQL Injection]] before sending it.

NOTE: See [[HTML Entity Encoding]] which is a sort of output validation.
