Eventually this tool will have another optional component that will allow fuzzing of these requests from within the tool itself if desired. However, at this point the AJAX crawling functionality is the true value. The target would be to have an automated fuzzing tool that would crawl a target site (including SOAP and REST) and then fuzz those discovered requests. At the end, the tools deliverables would be for QA/Researchers to discover unprotected entry points and malformed input.
