==Description==
Functions with inconsistent implementations across operating systems and operating system versions cause portability problems.

The behavior of functions in this category varies by operating system, and at times, even by operating system version. Implementation differences can include:

* Slight differences in the way parameters are interpreted, leading to inconsistent results. 
* Some implementations of the function carry significant security risks. 
* The function might not be defined on all platforms.
