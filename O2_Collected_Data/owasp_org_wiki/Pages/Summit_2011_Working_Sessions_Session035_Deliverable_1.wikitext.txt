'''Objectives and action plan to improve OWASP presence in Brazil''' 

The following objectives were defined for OWASP in Brazil:

# A new Chapter has been created in the city of Recife. Its two leaders are: Felipe Ferraz and Rodrigo Assad
# The Brazilian Chapters must be empowered through periodic meetings
## Periodicity must be defined
## The meetings must be promoted to the Brazilian AppSec Community.
## The Chapter leaders must leverage the OWASP wiki and the specific mailing list to make the meetings happen
# The Brazilian groups and individuals that develop activities related to Application Security must be identified and contacted. Three categories have been defined
## Government
## Industry
## Academia
# The Summit synergies must be leveraged to increase the collaboration with other Latin American Countries
# Boost the 3rd AppSec Brasil (1st AppSec LA) by the creation of an Latin-American organization committee focused in the local efforts to seek resources and event promotion. This committee should contribute to the success of the event.
# have a working session at AppSec Brasil to assess the outcomes of the item 3 above.
# Seek OWASP financial support to start the project
# Keep the efforts to approach industry, government and academia to
promote and empower OWASP.
