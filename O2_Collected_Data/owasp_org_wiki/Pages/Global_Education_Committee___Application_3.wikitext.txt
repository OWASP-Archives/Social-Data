As the French Leader I'm applying to Education Global Committee for sharing the Europe/French vision and helping to spread OWASP Education. I'm currently doing some teaching in French University about AppSec and to some company.

I think I could help to translate some materials in French, and spread it to the French community.

my resume is online at http://www.linkedin.com/in/gioria
