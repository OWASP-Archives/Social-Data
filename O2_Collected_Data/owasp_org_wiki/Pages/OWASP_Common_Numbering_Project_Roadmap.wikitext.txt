This common numbering will be of requirements. A mapping of vulnerabilities to this requirements list will most likely be developed after the common requirements list is created. This common numbering scheme is intended to be independent of any particular OWASP project and is not intended to dictate how those projects are developed and organized. Its intent is to be a resource to facilitate cross referencing between related topics and to encourage, but not require, projects like the OWASP Guides to adopt a similar structure. But that decision is up to the respective project leads.
