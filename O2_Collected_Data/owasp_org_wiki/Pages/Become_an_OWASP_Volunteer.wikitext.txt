==Who Can Help==

Anyone can help OWASP simply by finding tasks that need to be completed and taking them on. Some tasks require a great deal of technical expertise, while others are fine for those who are looking to help but aren't yet confident in their application security skills.

==How to Get Started==

In order to edit the materials at OWASP, you'll need to create an account. Then you'll need to find some tasks that need to be completed.
#You can start by looking at some [[:Category:OWASP_Project|projects]] that you're interested in to see if there are any open tasks.
#You can also check the [[Main Page|OWASP front page]] for any critical tasks.
#To browse the full list of tasks, you can look for [[:Category:Stub|stubs]] of articles that need to be completed.

==Working with Others==

There are three main ways to interact with other folks at OWASP.
#The first is to use the "discussion" pages associated with each OWASP article. Please use these pages to discuss approaches and document decisions. 
#You can also use the mailing lists for each project to communicate with a list of people interested in a particular project
#Lastly, you can use the forums (coming soon) to discuss issues related to OWASP and application security.
