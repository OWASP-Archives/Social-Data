==Description==
An open redirect is an application that takes a parameter and redirects a user to the parameter value without any validation. This vulnerability is used in phishing attacks to get users to visit malicious sites without realizing it.

'''Consequences'''

[[Phishing]]

'''Platform'''
All web platforms affected


==Risk Factors==

TBD

==Examples==

http://www.vulnerable.com?redirect=http://www.attacker.com

The phishing use can be more complex, using complex encoding:

Real redirect: http://www.vulnerable.com/redirect.asp?=http://www.links.com

Faked link: http://www.vulnerable.com/security/advisory/23423487829/../../../redirect.asp%3F%3Dhttp%3A//www.facked.com/advisory/system_failure/password_recovery_system

* [[Attack 1]]
* [[Attack 2]]


==Related [[Vulnerabilities]]==

* [[Open forward]]

==Related [[Controls]]==

* To avoid the open redirect vulnerability, parameters of the application script/program must be validated before sending 302 HTTP code (redirect) to the client browser.

The server must have a relation of the authorized redirections (i.e. in a database).
