==Description==

The finalize() method should only be called by the JVM after the object has been garbage collected.

While the Java Language Specification allows an object's finalize() method to be called from outside the finalizer, doing so is usually a bad idea. For example, calling finalize() explicitly means that finalize() will be called more than once: the first time will be the explicit call and the last time will be the call that is made after the object is garbage collected.

==Examples==

The following code fragment calls finalize() explicitly:

<pre>
	// time to clean up
	widget.finalize();

</pre>
