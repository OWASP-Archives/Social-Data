==Description==

This method fails to override a similar method in its superclass because their parameter lists do not match.

This method declaration looks like an attempt to override a method in a superclass, but the parameter lists do not match, so the superclass method is not overridden.


==Risk Factors==

TBD

==Examples==

The class DeepFoundation is meant to override the method getArea() in its parent class, but the parameter lists are out of sync.

<pre>
	public class Foundation
	{
	  public int getArea() {
		...
	  }
	}
	
	class DeepFoundation extends Foundation
	{
	  public int getArea(int a) {
		...
	  }
	}
</pre>
