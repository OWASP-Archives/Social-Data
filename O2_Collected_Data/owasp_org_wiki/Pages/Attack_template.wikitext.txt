==Description==

An attack is an action taken by a threat agent to exploit a vulnerability. Be sure you don't put [threat agents] or [vulnerabilities] in this category.

# Start with a one-sentence description of the attack
# How is the attack is launched?
# Who are the likely threat agents?
# What vulnerability does this attack target?


==Risk Factors==

* Talk about the [[OWASP Risk Rating Methodology|factors]] that make this attack likely or unlikely to actually happen
* You can mention the likely technical impact of an attack
* The [business impact] of an attack is probably conjecture, leave it out unless you're sure
