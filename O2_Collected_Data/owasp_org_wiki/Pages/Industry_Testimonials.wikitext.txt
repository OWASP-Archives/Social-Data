Testimonials and endorsements from organisations using OWASP resources or working with OWASP to improve application security.  Testimonials were sought from named individuals in higher profile organizations where it was known they were using OWASP materials or had worked with OWASP.  Their successes in using or working with OWASP are very dependent on their own efforts — other organizations may not achieve the same results, or may achieve more.

=== Standards and guidelines ===

* "The Cloud Security Alliance is focused on developing a set of guidelines that customers and vendors of cloud based systems can use as a common set of guidelines for dealing with security in Cloud based systems. A significant part of this effort has been developing standards that address Application Security and the differences that must be considered when moving application to a Cloud based environment. The members of OWASP were critical to both the development of these sections of the standard as well as providing an expert community that helped to verify the guidance is valid. With the help of many OWASP members we have been able to provide a [http://www.cloudsecurityalliance.org/csaguide.pdf set of guidance] that is comprehensive while providing a rational balance between security and business needs. I would like to personally thank the OWASP community for their contributions."
