[[Image:Owasp_logo_normal.jpg|right]]As the Information Security profession continue to mature, the competition for highly sought after positions will continue to increase. Effective career management is going to be critical to your personal success and attainment of your individual career goals. In the free agent economy of the future, you will be forced to treat your career as your own personal business. Effectively you will become the CEO of YOU INC. Building on the success of last year's OWASP presentation "7 Habits of Highly Effective Career Managers"¬ù, Lee Kushner will discuss in great detail practical lessons for managing your career in the future. Much of the content for the presentation will be driven from his own personal experience of running an Information Security recruitment firm over the past decade. The presentation will include information on the topics of brand development, opportunity identification, differentiation, networking, and career ethics.
