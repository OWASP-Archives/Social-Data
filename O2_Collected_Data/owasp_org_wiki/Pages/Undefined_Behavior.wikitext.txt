==Description==

The behavior of this function is undefined unless its control parameter is set to a specific value.

The Linux Standard Base Specification 2.0.1 for libc places constraints on the arguments to some internal functions [1]. If the constraints are not met, the behavior of the functions is not defined.

It is unusual for this function to be called directly. It is almost always invoked through a macro defined in a system header file, and the macro ensures that the following constraints are met:

The value 1 must be passed to the third parameter (the version number) of the following file system function:

<pre>
	__xmknod
</pre>

The value 2 must be passed to the third parameter (the group argument) of the following wide character string functions:

<pre>
	__wcstod_internal
	__wcstof_internal
	__wcstol_internal
	__wcstold_internal
	__wcstoul_internal
</pre>

The value 3 must be passed as the first parameter (the version number) of the following file system functions:

<pre>
	__xstat
	__lxstat
	__fxstat
	__xstat64
	__lxstat64
	__fxstat64

</pre>
