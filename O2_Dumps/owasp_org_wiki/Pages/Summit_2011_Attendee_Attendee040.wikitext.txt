Have been working on application security issues for over 8 years
(focused on security code review for last 3+ years).  Published
articles related to enterprise application integration, scalability,
and security.  Been recently focused on XSS remediation and DOM based
XSS.  Also interested in Unicode exploits and filter bypassing using
character set mismatches.  Recently contributed the candidate chapter

contribute more to XSS, AJAX security, Unicode content on the OWASP
