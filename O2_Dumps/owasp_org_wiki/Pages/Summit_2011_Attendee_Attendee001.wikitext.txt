Dinis is an active trainer on .Net security, having written and delivered courses for Ounce Labs, IOActive, Foundstone, Intense School and KPMG (at multiple locations including BlackHat). Dinis has also delivered a number of presentations and keynote speeches at multiple OWASP and Security related conferences. 
As a security researcher Dinis created a number of innovative tools and research documents, and has responsible disclosed a number of Critical vulnerabilities on Commercial Applications (for example Microsoft's Advisory MS07-040 on the .NET Framework, or the Spring MVC Auto-Binding issue) 
At OWASP, Dinis is the leader of the OWASP O2 Platform project, member of the OWASP Global Projects Committee, chair of the OWASP Connections Committee and member of the OWASP Board (and has been a key driven on a number of major OWASP Initiatives: OWASP Seasons of Code, OWASP Summit 2008 in Portugal, OWASP Community building and OWASP Chapter-lead Training)
