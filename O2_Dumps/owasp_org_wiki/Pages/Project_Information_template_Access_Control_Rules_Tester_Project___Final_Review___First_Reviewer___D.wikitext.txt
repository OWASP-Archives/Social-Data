Each defined goal has been met, with the exception of the following:
* AcCoRuTe functionality including site spider. Basic features: Javascript (and AJAX) is interpreted by Rhino in order to get more site links; forms are filled in by operator. 

This is acceptable, as the application utilizes a third-party tool instead to provide this spidering feature.

*The document(s) should be on some sort of OWASP letterhead or word document template. 
*In order to be release quality, the english grammar will need to be reviewed and mistakes will need to be corrected.
*Utilizing Wikipedia / Blogs as reference points are generally not considered credible. Is it possible to reference more credible references?
*The Requirements to run the tool are stated as "•	At least 50 GB of available HDD space. " Is this true?
*When attempting to run the tool, it complained that I needed to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable, although I have run many java applications (for example Paros) within windows and have not had to use this. Is there a way around this requirement (for ease of set-up)? If not, maybe include these instructions
*Several of the instructions relating to setting up Burp Proxy are incorrect, as burp has updated to version 2 and changed many options.
**Going forward, it would be desirable to remove the dependancy of Burp Proxy.
