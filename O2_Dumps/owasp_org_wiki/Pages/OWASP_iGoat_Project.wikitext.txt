Welcome to the iGoat OWASP project home page.

iGoat is a learning tool for iOS developers (iPhone, iPad, etc.). It was inspired by the WebGoat project, and has a similar conceptual flow to it.

As such, iGoat is a safe environment where iOS developers can learn about the major security pitfalls they face as well as how to avoid them. It is made up of a series of lessons that each teach a single (but vital) security lesson.

The lessons are laid out in the following steps:

1 - Brief introduction to the problem.

2 - Verify the problem by exploiting it.

3 - Brief description of available remediations to the problem.

4 - Fix the problem by correcting and rebuilding the iGoat program.

Step 4 is optional, but highly recommended for all iOS developers. Assistance is available within iGoat if you don't know how to fix a specific problem.

iGoat is free software, released under the GPLv3 license.


Framework

iGoat has been designed and built to be a foundation on which to build a series of iOS security lessons. The initial iGoat release will include a handful of lessons to work through, but one of the aims of the project is to build a community of developers to help build out additional lessons over time -- much as WebGoat has before it.

Interested contributors are encouraged to contact the project leader (Ken van Wyk, ken@krvw.com) to find out how they can contribute to future releases of iGoat.


Status

The iGoat project was launched in May 2011. Version 1.2 released on 29 March 2012. Source repository and download site:
