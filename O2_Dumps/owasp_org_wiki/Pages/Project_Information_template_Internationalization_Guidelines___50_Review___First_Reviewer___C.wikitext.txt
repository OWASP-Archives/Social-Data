In order to complete the project, Larry needs to help Juan Carlos making the changes in OWASP.org site so contents could be uploaded  to the production instance.<br />
Once this is done, the reviewers will start verifying the contents published.<br />
As an overall score the project is currently at 50-60% completed.
