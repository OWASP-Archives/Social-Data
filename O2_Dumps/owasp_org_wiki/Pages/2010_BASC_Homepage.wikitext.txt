{{2010_BASC:Header_Template | Welcome}}
This is the homepage for the 2010 Boston Application Security Conference (BASC). This free conference will take place on Saturday, November 20<sup>th</sup> at [http://microsoftcambridge.com/Default.aspx Microsoft New England Research and Development Center (NERD)].

The BASC will be a free, one day, informal conference, aimed at increasing awareness and knowledge of application security in the greater Boston area. While many of the presentations will cover state-of-the-art application security concepts, the BASC is intended to appeal to a wide-array of attendees. Application security professionals, professional software developers, software quality engineers, computer science students, and security software vendors should be able to come to the BASC, learn, and hopefully enjoy themselves at the same time.
