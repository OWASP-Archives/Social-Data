'''ANSA - Asp.Net Security Analyzer'''

Asp.Net Security Analyser (ANSA) is a Windows based online tool that tests a server's security for known security vulnerabilities within an Asp.Net shared hosting environment.

This was the first tool developed by Dinis Cruz that highlights the security problems of Full Trust Asp.Net code (contains Proof of Concept tests (i.e. exploits))
