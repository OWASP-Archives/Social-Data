'''OWASP Summit 2011 Remote Participation Poll'''

The OWASP Global Summit is the place where application security experts meet to discuss plans, projects and solutions for the future of application security. The Summit is not a conference - there are no talks or training seminars - this is an opportunity to do actual work to further the field of application security.

For those who were unable to make for Summit OWASP is trying to arrange a remote participation opportunity. For the organization team it's very important to know:

- the approximate number of remote participants;

- the prevailing type of remote participants: attendees or active participants;

- the working sessions considered most attractive.

We are kindly asking to fill in the poll everybody who is interested in remote participation:
