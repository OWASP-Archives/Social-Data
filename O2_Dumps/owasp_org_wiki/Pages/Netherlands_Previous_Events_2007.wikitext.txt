== Meeting minutes December 20th 2007 ==

At December 20th, the Dutch OWASP chapter came together at the office of ps_testware located in Doorn. The subject of the evening was 'creating secure (web)applications. There were 3 speakers and close to 30 attendees  <br/>
<br/>
'''First presentation:''' Practices of developing optimal security (dutch), Andre Post<br/>
Andre talked from his rich experience as software auditor and code reviewer. Based on his experience he stated that developing good, secure software can only be done with developers with the right set of mind. Security should not be tested into the software, but should be a natural thing for developers to develop into the software. For this you need developers who know by heart when security flaws start to exist and how to prevent them. Developers with the necessary experience are rare and often developer teams do not have the right expertise for developing secure software. The most important conclusion of his speech was that secure software starts with security aware developers.<br/>
<br/>
'''Second presentation:''' Problems of developing secure and correct applications (dutch), Erik Poll<br/>
Erik Poll stated that besides having developers who are aware of security, you should also have developers that now the limitations and inherent security leaks of the used language. One of the problems is that many developers are not taught the inherent security holes in programming languages during their education. <br/>
Another problem is that software is often made secure for the wrong reasons. At this moment only two reasons appear to be the drive behind developing secure software: economics and laws. Security is mostly of secondary concern and as such will only be implemented at minimum requirements. Bad examples of big companies who develop insecure software and still be successful even further restrict the demand for secure software.<br/>
On the positive side many developers make the same mistakes so testing for common security holes can easily be done with checklists and validation tools. These validation tools can be made more successful with the use of metatags in the code.<br/>
Erik concluded his speech that improving the secureness of software can only be achieved when there is commitment, the knowledge is available and software is developed and implemented with a secure mind.     <br/>
<br/>
'''Third presentation:''' Protecting Web services and Web applications against security threats, Rix Groenboom<br/>
The third presentation was about a problem which probably will become bigger and bigger the coming years. Although security might be in the scope when developing software at this moment, it certainly was not a requirement 20 or more years ago. Despite their intrinsic insecureness, these systems are connected more and more to the world wide web to meet de demands for online availability. This imposes a major security risk which will become more evident in the years to come and might become bigger than the Y2K problem. Unlike modern software, these applications can only be made secure enough by using advanced testing strategies  combined with the use of test-tools and thorough regression tests. Testing alone however is not enough; to accomplish maximum secureness all connections to these systems should be based on a 'deny unless' instead of an 'allow unless' basis. <br/>
The conclusion of Rix's talk was that old systems connected to new interfaces should be treated as insecure and all possible precautions should be taken to achieve an acceptable level of secureness.<br/>

== Meeting December 20th 2007: Secure Development ==
'''Summary'''<br/>
The main goal of the upcoming OWASP-NL meeting is to provide information to developers and security professionals involved in creating secure (web-)applications. The general and specific security issues involved on project and programming level will be covered from a practical as well as a theoretical point of view. The speakers will give specific examples and of course there is time to ask questions about your own experiences.<br/>
Please register before December the 14th  because of the necessary catering arrangements.<br/>

== Meeting March 9th 2007: Second meeting of the OWASP Netherlands local chapter! ==

In this second meeting focus groups are to be formed, to discuss common problems, develop and research common solutions in a vendor neutral environment. So this is a very good opportunity to get in contact with others, to exchange knowledge and experiences on specific topics.<br/>
<br/>
For every focus group the following questions has to be answered:<br/>
1. Which specific topic is to be addressed?<br/>
2. What are the deliverables?<br/>
3. What is the relation to OWASP? (Current projects, materials, expertise and knowledge interchange, etc.)<br/>
4. Who is the central contact of the subgroup?<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice to have a bigger and more diverse group, compared to the first meeting. So let's recall: "Please, bring at least one friend, next time." And don't hesitate to send this announcement to everybody who may be interested!<br/>

Presentation Abstract<br/>
Rather than spending large amounts of time and money on proving that we have security vulnerabilities after programs go into production, companies should go to the source and correct vulnerabilities as early as possible in the development stage. It is unquestionably faster, simpler, and cheaper for developers to correct vulnerabilities as they build programs.<br/>
But how can development management ensure that developers focus on security when there is no time or budget for security at the development stage? Even with the correct focus, how can they learn what to look for? How can they stay ahead of the dedicated and resourceful hacker?<br/>
The answer is effective processes and better tools. With advanced software security tools, a developer can pinpoint vulnerabilities in a matter of seconds — the same vulnerabilities that would take a hacker or manual code reviewer weeks or even months to find. These same tools can give development and information security managers useful metrics on application vulnerabilities before they are released into deployment.<br/>
This talk will walk through the Application Development Life-Cycle and discuss how tools can help come to grips with software security issues in a particular phase.<br/>
<br/>

After being welcomed by Frank Langeveld from Sogeti and Bert Koelewijn, Dutch chapter leader, the evening started with the presentation 'Security By Design'. During the presentation Martin Knobloch told about his experiences during the implementation of the Secure Development Life Cycle in a company like Sogeti Nederland B.V.<br/>
<br/>
The presentation is available here:<br/>
[[Media:Implementation_of_Security_by_Design.ppt]]<br/>
<br/>
After a small break, the panel discussion started with the following panel: Henk van der Heijden - Comsec Consulting, Dr.ir. Mario de Boer - LogicaCMG and Martin Knobloch - Sogeti Nederland.<br/>
During the discussion, it became clear people are struggling to get the Secure Development Life Cycle implemented in their company. The various experiences were shared with the panel and the others. Company typical problems and common misunderstandings about Software security where brought up.<br/>
The consensus of the discussion was that the main problem lies in the lack of security awareness and knowledge of the managers and the developers. And this of course is exactly where OWASP comes in…<br/>
<br/>

== Meeting Januar 11th 2007 ==

The OWASP meeting of 11 January is about putting software security into practice. A lot of books, standards, organizations and consultants tell us how we should develop secure software. But which methods and measures are commonly adopted and which are not and why?<br/>
This will be the main focus of the discussion that we will have with a panel of people that experienced implementing software security in the field.<br/>
