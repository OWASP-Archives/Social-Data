== Possible Enhancements == 

* Make ESAPI factory class (i.e. ESAPI.java) data driven so that you don't have to change code to select your company's implementation of the ESAPI interfaces

* Move "admin" like functions to a separate API to keep the base API very simple

* Create a command line interface to facilitate integration with other environments

* Make ESAPI configs work on either a "per-app" or "global" basis.  Probably use a global set that can be overridden by individual applications.
