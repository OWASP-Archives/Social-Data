'''Wednesday, May 11th 2011, 5:00-6:00 PM ''' - ''Mobile Security for the Forgetful''

'''Location: [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=315+Front+Street+West,+Toronto,+Ontario,+Canada, Auditorium C, 315 Front Street West, Toronto, ON M5V 3A4]'''

Please RSVP to '''yukfai at securitycompass dotcom'''

'''Description:''' You’ve accidentally misplaced your company or personal mobile phone in a public location. In this scenario, what threats do you and/or your organization face?  

This talk will be about the worst case scenario in mobile security: when the attacker has physical access to the phone. According to DataLossDB, about 1/5 of all data breaches they have recorded are due to lost or stolen laptops. Phones are much easier to lose (or steal) then laptops, and these days the data on our phones can be as confidential as the data on our laptops.

This talk will go over physical access attacks from an attacker’s perspective, discuss ways of coding mobile applications to defend against these kinds of attacks, and discuss some ways of securing our phones as users. Technical details in this talk will focus on the Android platform.

Length: 60 minutes

'''Speaker Bio:''' Max Veytsman is a Security Consultant with Security Compass. He specializes in web and mobile security assessments. Max also leads Security Compass' training development in the mobile space. Max studied Computer Science at the University of Toronto. His interests include cryptography, programming language design, and computer vision.

'''Wednesday, February 16th, 6:00 PM'''- ''How Auditors Certify Computer Systems – A Look at Third Party, Non-Vendor, Legally Mandated System Certifications''

'''Location: [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=425+adelaide+street+west+toronto&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=36.915634,52.382813&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=425+Adelaide+St+W,+Toronto,+Toronto+Division,+Ontario,+Canada&ll=43.647846,-79.398043&spn=0.008245,0.012789&z=16&iwloc=A, 425 Adelaide Street West, Suite 702]'''

Please RSVP to '''laura at securitycompass dotcom'''

'''Description:'''“Certifications” abound in the world of IT – from signoffs by internal security professionals to the advertising claims of vendors, but few, if any of these, have true legal standing.  As a consequence,  customers and clients of organizations which process sensitive transactions or retain confidential data are increasingly demanding third party, non-vendor, legally mandated system certification as a pre-requisite to doing business. 

•	What are these certifications and who can issue them?

•	Under what circumstances are certifications likely to be required? 

•	What standards do certifiers use – and does it matter?

•	What information and evidence do auditors need in order to complete their work?

•	How can information systems professionals prepare for a certification audit and ensure that the process is ultimately successful?


Our speaker, Jerrard Gaertner, CA•CISA/IT, CGEIT, CISSP, CIPP/IT, I.S.P., ITCP, CIA, CFI, Director of Technology Assurance Services at Soberman LLP, will address these and related questions based on his 25+ years as a systems auditor.

'''Title:''' Software Assurance Maturity Model

'''Speaker:''' Pravir Chandra, Fortify Software

'''Description:'''Software Assurance Maturity Model (OpenSAMM) 
The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) into a software development organization. Covering more than typical SDLC-based models for security, SAMM enables organizations to self-assess their security assurance program and then use recommended roadmaps to improve in a way that's aligned to the specific risks facing the organization. Beyond that, SAMM enables creation of scorecards for an organization's effectiveness at secure software development throughout the typical governance, development, and deployment business functions. Scorecards also enable management within an organization to demonstrate quantitative improvements through iterations of building a security assurance program. This workshop will introduce the SAMM framework and walk through useful activities such as assessing an assurance program, mapping an existing organization to a recommended roadmap, and iteratively building an assurance program. Time allowing, additional case studies will also be discussed. OpenSAMM is an open a free project and has recently been donated to the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Foundation. For more information on OpenSAMM, visit http://www.opensamm.org/

'''Date/Time:''' May 13th, 2009, 6:45-8:00 PM EST

'''Title:''' Cross Site AJAX Hacking

'''Description:''' The era of AJAX technologies has only been possible after XMLHttpRequest released its full potential. But XMLHttpRequest has had a number of security concerns, in particular due to its ability to create flexible requests against web sites without the users knowledge. Up to now, the same origin policy limited the impact of this issue.

The Web 2.0 vision calls for the flexible use and rendering of information in mash-ups created by mixing content from various sources on the fly. This idea is not easily implemented in Javascript due to same origin restrictions. In order to allow for these features, XHR Level 2 and XDR have been developed to remove the same origin policy and allow the ability to request information from various sites. Current browsers make these functions available to developers and you will soon find sites that require them. The presentation will provide information on the mechanics of these cross site AJAX calls and their security impact.  

As an add-on to the discussion - It has been a year since Johannes Ullrich have given a talk on Dshield Web App honeypot project. I will provide a small update on the progress of this project. It's a low key project but you may be amazed at what we are doing. 

'''Presenter:''' Jason Lam

'''BIO:'''Jason is a senior security analyst at a major financial institute in Canada. He is also an author and instructor for SANS Institute where he writes courses on pentesting and defending web applications.

<B> Topic: </B> A Laugh RIAt  – Rich Internet Application Security

<B> Speaker: </B> Rafal M. Los 

<B> Description: </B> Rich Internet Applications [RIA] are popping up everywhere!  Enterprises and boutique online shops alike are rushing to adopt these technologies without really thinking of the implications of moving pseudo-server functionality to the user’s desktop and browser.  Hacking these applications has now moved from the challenge of compromising the server, to the significantly smaller challenge of compromising the client.  You’ll be able to witness (and try!) first-hand how to manipulate an AJAX-rich web application you or your colleagues probably use many times; as well as see and understand how breaking down a Flash binary object (SWF file) isn’t difficult.  These types of applications are now treasure-troves of goodies… don’t miss out on the simple ways you can security test these technologies on your desktop today!

<B>Date/Time:</B> August 14th 2008, 6:00-7:30 PM EST 

<B>Title:</B> An Introduction To Reverse Engineering Malware

<B>Session Abstract:</B> This talk will cover the basics of setting up an environment to reverse engineer malware, and an introduction to some tools and techniques that can be used to determine what exactly that bit of unknown, potentially hostile code does. While this is an introductory talk, we'll definitely cover more than "run strings on the binary and see what you get!"

<B>Presenters:</B>  Seth Hardy, MessageLabs Inc.

<B>BIO:</B> Seth Hardy recently moved to Toronto to do reverse engineering work for MessageLabs, as part of their antivirus research and response group.

<B>Date/Time:</B> July 16th 2008, 6:00-7:30 PM EST 

<B>Title:</B> Business Logic Flaws

<B>Session Abstract:</B> How they put your Websites at Risk Session handling, credit card transactions, and password recovery are just a few examples of Web-enabled business logic processes that malicious hackers have abused to compromise major websites. These types of vulnerabilities are routinely overlooked during QA because the process is intended to test what a piece of code is supposed to do and not what it can be made to do. The other problem(s) with business logic flaws is scanners can't identify them, IDS can't detect them, and Web application firewalls can't defend them. Plus, the more sophisticated and Web 2.0 feature-rich a website, the more prone it is to have flaws in business logic.The presentation will provide real-world examples of how pernicious and dangerous business logic flaws are to the security of a website. We'll also show how best to spot them and provide organizations with a simple and rational game plan to prevent them.

<B>Presenters:</B>  Trey Ford, Director, Solutions Architecture, WhiteHat Security, Inc.

<B>BIO:</B> Trey Ford is the Director of Solutions Architecture at WhiteHat Security, providing strategic guidance to WhiteHat customers and prospects on their website security programs.  Mr. Ford also spearheads WhiteHat's participation in the PCI Standards Council and assists customers in selecting WhiteHat services for compliance with the PCI Data Security Standard.

<B>Topic: </B> A Distributed Web Application Honeypot <br/><br/>
<B>Date/Time:</B> May 13th 2008, 6:00-7:00 PM EST <br/><br/>
<B>Description:</B>
DShield.org has been extremely helpful in understanding network based attacks. However, over the last few years many interesting attacks target specific web application flaws which are not detected by DShield's sensor system. Collecting similar data for web applications has been challenging for a number of reasons. First of all, the data needed to understand a web application attack is much richer and a simple efficient data model as the one used by DShield will not provide sufficient details. If more detailed data, like complete requests, are collected, data privacy issues become more of a problem. Simple obfuscation or pattern replacement techniques are usually not sufficient to safeguard this information, or they will make it impossible to understand the attack. Lastly, many web application attacks use search engines to find vulnerable systems, instead of just attacking random servers. Over the next few months we plan to roll out a distributed web application honeypot. We will describe how this honeypot will be implemented to address these issues.



<B>Speaker BIO: Dr. Johannes Ullrich</B>
SANS Institute As Chief Research Officer for the SANS Institute, Johannes is currently responsible for the SANS Internet Storm Center (ISC) and the GIAC Gold program. He founded DShield.org in 2000, which is now the data collection engine behind the ISC.
