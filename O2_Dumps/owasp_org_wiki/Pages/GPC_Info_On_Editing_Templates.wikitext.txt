for an example of this in action see [[OWASP_Project_Details_Table]] which uses the [[Template:OWASP_Project_Details_Row]] to create the row table from each project information page, for example:
* [[Template:Project Details/OWASP Flash Security Project]]
* [[Template:Project Details/OWASP Live CD]]

The content should be on a page called: GPC_Project_Details/{project name} , for example the content for the [[:Category:OWASP XML Security Gateway Evaluation Criteria Project]] should be at the page [[GPC_Project_Details/OWASP XML Security Gateway Evaluation Criteria]] and you have to make sure that the template is set to:
<pre>

  {{Template:<includeonly>{{{1}}}</includeonly><noinclude>OWASP Project Identification Tab</noinclude> 
 | project_name = OWASP XML Security Gateway Evaluation Criteria Project 
 | project_description = 
 .....
 }} 
 __NOTOC__ <headertabs />
</pre>

The good news of the way this template is now set-up is that the user can view the 'template driven page' with a nice table format [[GPC_Project_Details/OWASP_XML_Security_Gateway_Evaluation_Criteria]] and at the same time we can use that same information on other pages, for example on [[OWASP_Project_Details_Table]] by simply pointing to the content page and the template to use:
<pre>
 {{:GPC_Project_Details/OWASP_XML_Security_Gateway_Evaluation_Criteria | OWASP Project Details Row}}
</pre>

what the above line is doing is transforming the content of [[GPC_Project_Details/OWASP_XML_Security_Gateway_Evaluation_Criteria]] with the template [[template:OWASP Project Details Row]]
Note the : on the GPC_Project_Details since without it the name has to start with Template, for example: Template:GPC_Project_Detail
