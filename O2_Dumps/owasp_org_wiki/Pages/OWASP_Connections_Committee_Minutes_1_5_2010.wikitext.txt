New time for standing calls 10pm on Tuesdays - Robert and Lorna in Central time, Justin and Dinis on BST time

Review of committee responsibilities, and to shape priorities 

We don't always need to do the work - we just need to make sure it is occurring

We may end up starting a lot of things - newsletter a great example. Get started, and hand off to someone to keep running

First 3 areas
* PR (including newsletter) (Lorna)
* training courses (Justin)
* promoting OWASP to non-core groups [developers] (Robert)

Robert - one of the problems realized in Austin OWASP group - we have a hard time talking to CISOs
* Lot of stuff outside of web app sec - we get pigeon holed
* Great bridge is to put on mini-conference on open source apps that affect organizations (wordpress, drupal, joomla etc). 
* Ideas on how to make OWASP more attractive by speaking same language
* ways to utilize existing platforms and tie back to existing vision

Lorna - minneapolis pitching for next OWASP conference
* outreach to CISOs

Robert - cloud an opportunity to reach CISOs, talk with them about what their real needs are
* third group is developers

* not chasing the people who don't think security is important
* we want to be accessible to people who think its important and want to learn

KPIs - how many people we enabled the presentation of OWASP who'd never heard of us before
