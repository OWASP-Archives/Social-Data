==Description==

Draw strong boundaries among application elements, including modules, functions and data, to limit the impact of potential attacks. 

==Examples ==
* Design 
** Separate internal administrator's functions from external users' functions  
** Differentiate between validated data and unvalidated data, between one user's data and another's, or between data users are allowed to see and data that they are not.
** In a web browser ensure that your mobile code cannot be abused by other mobile code.
* Implementation
** Hide internal details of a class, including data and methods, using private access modifier.
