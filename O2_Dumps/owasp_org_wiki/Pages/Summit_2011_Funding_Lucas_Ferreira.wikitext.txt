Back in 2008 I barely knew OWASP. I was beginning to read OWASP's guides and used OWASP WebSacrab for my job. In November 2008, I got the opportunity to participate in the first OWASP Summit (which coincidentally also happened in Portugal).

This gathering of OWASP's most active and passionate leaders changed my view of the organization and made me become more involved in its activities. Since this first Summit, we managed to bring to life two AppSec Brasil conferences (2009 and 2010) and moved from a single Brazilian chapter to the five chapters we now have.

For me, the Summit is the best opportunity to really know OWASP by meeting the people that make OWASP's success history. There is no better time to become involved in OWASP than a Summit.

Your help in participating or funding the Summit will certainly help OWASP leaders to generate new ideas, projects and more quality products from OWASP.
