[[category:FIXME: can this be combined with the Insufficient Entropy article?]]

==Description==

True random number generators generally have a limited source of entropy and therefore can fail or block.

'''Consequences'''

* Availability: A program may crash or block if it runs out of random numbers.

'''Exposure period'''

* Requirements specification: Choose an operating system which is aggressive and effective at generating true random numbers.
* Implementation: This type of failure is a logical flaw which can be exacerbated by a lack of or the misuse of mitigating technologies.

'''Platform'''

* Languages: Any
* Operating platforms: Any

'''Required resources'''

Any

'''Severity'''

Medium

'''Likelihood of exploit'''

Low to Medium

The rate at which true random numbers can be generated is limited. It is important that one uses them only when they are needed for security.


==Risk Factors==

TBA

==Examples==

In C:

<pre>
while (1){
  if (connection){
    if (hwRandom()){
      //use the random bytes
    }
    else (hwRandom()) {
      //cancel the program
  } 
}
</pre>

==Related [[Vulnerabilities]]==

* [[Vulnerability 1]]
* [[Vulnerabiltiy 2]]


==Related [[Controls]]==

* Implementation: Rather than failing on a lack of random numbers, it is often preferable to wait for more numbers to be created.
