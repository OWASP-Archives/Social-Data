==Description==

The use of Non-cryptographic Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) as a source for security can be very dangerous, since they are predictable. 

'''Consequences'''

* Authentication: Potentially a weak source of random numbers could weaken the encryption method used for authentication of users. In this case, a password could potentially be discovered.

'''Exposure period'''

* Design through Implementation: It is important to realize that if one is utilizing randomness for important security, one should use the best random numbers available.

'''Platform'''

* Languages: All languages.
* Operating platforms: All platforms.

'''Required resources'''

Any

'''Severity'''

High

'''Likelihood of exploit'''

Medium

Often a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is not designed for cryptography. Sometimes a mediocre source of randomness is sufficient or preferable for algorithms which use random numbers. Weak generators generally take less processing power and/or do not use the precious, finite, entropy sources on a system. 


==Risk Factors==

TBD

==Examples==

In C\C++:

<pre>
srand(time())
int randNum = rand();
</pre>

In Java:

<pre>
Random r = new Random();
</pre>

For a given seed, these "random number" generators will produce a reliable stream of numbers. Therefore, if an attacker knows the seed or can guess it easily, he will be able to reliably guess your random numbers.

==Related [[Controls]]==

* Design through Implementation: Use functions or hardware which use a hardware-based random number generation for all crypto. This is the recommended solution. Use CryptGenRandom on Windows, or hw_rand() on Linux.
