1. At what extent have the project deliveries & objectives been accomplished?  Having in consideration [[OWASP Summer of Code 2008 Applications#Python Static Analysis|'''the assumed ones''']], please exemplify writing down those of them that haven't been realised.
 | colspan="2" style="width:75%; background:#cccccc" align="left"| 

There's a working version now with almost full Python language support. It still requires some improvements which are planned to do in the next section.
The tool documentation is not written yet and publication article is not written too.

2. At what extent have the project deliveries & objectives been accomplished?  Having in consideration [[OWASP Summer of Code 2008 Applications#Python Static Analysis|'''the assumed ones''']], please quantify in terms of percentage.
 | colspan="2" style="width:75%; background:#cccccc" align="left"| 

 * full language support: about 80%
 * other Python frameworks: about 10%
 * analysis improvement: 30%
 * reporting capability: 70%
 * documentation: not started
 * article & presentation: not started

Assuming that coding phase (especially language support) is the most time consuming, I think that the project is completed at 60%

3. What kind of help is required either from the Reviewers or from the OWASP Community?

It will be great if reviewers think about additional functionality, that they want to see in the final version of the tool.
