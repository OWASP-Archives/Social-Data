==== Announcements  ====

== March Meeting ==

'''When:''' March 7, 2012, 11:30am - 1:00pm 

'''Topic: ''' AAA for Hybrid Cloud Environment

During this session, presented by Symplified, we will explore four areas of interest.

Web, SaaS, Mobile Application Adoption

Protecting sensitive data

WAM for the Public Cloud

Identity Sprawl

We will take an in depth look at what is driving enterprises to consider and migrate to Web, SaaS and Mobile applications. We then investigate Web Access Management where it started and why we need a new approach to meet the new needs. But we still need to consider the traditional tenants of Authentication, Authorization and Audit. These are still vitally important - even more so. Finally we will explore how identities are increasingly growing with this new paradigm and how we can control those identities. 

'''Who:''' Cullen Landrum, CISSP

With 10+ years of experience in Identity and Access Management, Cullen Landrum is a Senior Systems Engineer at Symplified. Cullen specializes in the areas of Federation and Access Management for Service Providers and Partners.

'''Abstract:'''

The Top 10 Mobile Application Risks, or “Mobile App Top 10” for short, is a list of the most prevalent risks to look for in the mobile applications you are developing and consuming.
 
Many of the risks in mobile devices are similar to those of traditional spyware, Trojan software, and insecurely designed apps. However, mobile devices are not just small computers. Mobile devices are designed around personal and communication functionality which makes the top mobile applications risks different from the top traditional computing risks.
 
The Mobile App Top 10 can be used to determine the coverage of a security solution which can protect against these risks. A mobile app security solution can declare its coverage of the Mobile App Top 10 so customers can understand what risks the solution mitigates. Mobile app security solutions can be used in the development of an app, as part of an app store vetting process, for acceptance testing of an app, or for security software running on a mobile device.
 
'''Speaker Bio:'''

Clint Pollock is a Senior Solutions Architect at Veracode. Since 1997, he has also created security solutions for large-scale enterprise environments on behalf of CREDANT Technologies and Netegrity. In his current role, Clint helps globally distributed organizations evaluate, track, and mitigate their application security risk.

'''Abstract''': 

This presentation outlines the primary risk concerns for application security, audit, and compliance then expands on those topics to create a "Checklist for Application Security, Systems, Internetworking, and Engineering". The presentation begins with understanding the types of risks involved, the current pitfalls (and in some cases pratfalls) companies struggle to endure, and what we can do to fix them. The presenter outlines the basic foundation on how to build a program for success, debunking the myth that you can’t have operational stability, security, and compliance while reducing operating costs, and how using this approach helps to achieve this goal.

Applications are currently a major attack vector as well as being difficult to keep stable, secure, and compliant. But securing only the applications, or just the infrastructure can lead to compromise; and audit, compliance, and legal problems. By applying the author's philosophy and  checklists to your organization, staff from support, engineering, application development, up to CISOs can more effectively work together to improve security and meet Executive Management’s tolerance for business risk while achieving business objectives. This presentation highlights the issues, demonstrates how the entire enterprise works together, and finally outlines a basic checklist and a methodology for CISOs, Developers, Administrators, and Engineers alike to ensure business and technology risk management work in concert with all technology areas, including audit and compliance.The method draws its strengths from proven frameworks such as OWASP, SAMM, Visible Ops, FFIEC, CoBIT, and ITIL.

'''Speaker Bio''':

'''Abstract''': 

One of the pain points of application penetration testing is keeping all your tools up to date and installed on whatever computer you happen to have with you. After several successful releases of the OWASP Live CD, I had a bit of a think and decided that there was a better way. After a bunch of re-tooling (the fancy word is refactoring), OWASP WTE is ready for prime time. OWASP Web Testing Environment is a project to package application testing tools and make them available in a variety of ways - you pick what works for you: Live CD, Virtual Machine, ala carte installations on your existing Ubuntu system, or maybe even attack tools in the cloud. The choice is yours with WTE. 

In this talk I will cover where OWASP WTE is currently, what features are available and what the future holds. The overall project goal is to make testing tools as widely available and easily usable as possible. 

'''Speaker Bio''':

'''Topic: ''' Protecting Your Applications from Backdoors: How to Security Your Business Critical Applications from Time Bombs, BAckdoors &amp; More 

With the increasing practice of outsourcing and using 3rd party libraries, it is nearly impossible for an enterprise to identify the pedigree and security of the software running its business critical applications. As a result backdoors and malicious code are increasingly becoming the prevalent attack vector used by hackers. Whether you manage internal development activities, work with third party developers or are developing a COTS application for enterprise, your mandate is clear- safeguard your code and make applications security a priority for internal and external development teams. In this session we will cover; • Prevalence of backdoors and malicious code in third party attacks • Definitions and classifications of backdoors and their impact on your applications • Methods to identify, track and remediate these vulnerabilities

'''Topic: ''' Technology and Business Risk Management: How Application Security Fits In 

This presentation demonstrates how important application security is to the overall stability and security of the infrastructure and ultimately, the business. Presented from the Information Security Officer/Risk Manager point of view, it shows how a strong information security program reduces levels of reputational, operational, legal, and strategic risk by limiting vulnerabilities, increasing stability, and maintaining customer confidence and trust. It focuses on the top concerns of risk managers and how application security fits into the overall risk management process. The audience will be given recommendations on how to improve cost effectiveness and efficiency to achieve business, security, audit, and compliance objectives relative to applications.

'''Topic: ''' Detective Work for Testers. Finding Workflow-based Defects. 

Workflow-based security defects in Web applications are especially difficult to identify because they evade traditional, point-and-scan vulnerability detection techniques. Understanding these potential defects and why black-box scanners typically miss them, are key to creating a testing strategy for successful detection and mitigation. Rafal Los describes the critical role that testers play in assessing application work flows and how business process-based testing techniques can uncover these flaws. Rafal demystifies the two main types of workflow-based application vulnerabilities-business process logic vulnerabilities and parameter-based vulnerabilities-and provides you with a sound basis to improve your testing strategies. Become a security testing sleuth and learn to find the workflow-based security defects before your system is compromised. 

'''Who:''' Rafal Los, Sr. Web Security Specialist, HP Software 

Senior Security Specialist with Hewlett-Packard’s Application Security Center (ASC), Rafal Los has more than thirteen years of experience in network and system design, security policy and process design, risk analysis, penetration testing, and consulting. For the past eight years, he has focused on information security and risk management, leading security architecture teams, and managing successful enterprise security programs for General Electric and other Fortune 100 companies, as well as SMB enterprises. Previously, Rafal spent three years in-house with GE Consumer Finance, leading its web application security programs.

'''When:''' Dallas February 25, 2009 11:30am – 1:30pm 

'''Topic:''' Vulnerability Management in an Application Security World. Identifying application-level vulnerabilities via penetration tests and code reviews is only the first step in actually addressing the underlying risk. Managing vulnerabilities for applications is more challenging than dealing with traditional infrastructure-level vulnerabilities because they typically require the coordination of security teams with application development teams and require security managers to secure time from developers during already-cramped development and release schedules. In addition, fixes require changes to custom application code and application-specific business logic rather than the patches and configuration changes that are often sufficient to address infrastructure-level vulnerabilities. This presentation details many of the pitfalls organizations encounter while trying to manage application-level vulnerabilities as well as outlines strategies security teams can use for communicating with development teams. Similarities and differences between security teams’ practice of vulnerability management and development teams’ practice of defect management will be addressed in order to facilitate healthy communication between these groups.

Abstract: 

Identifying application-level vulnerabilities via penetration tests and code reviews is only the first step in actually addressing the underlying risk. Managing vulnerabilities for applications is more challenging than dealing with traditional infrastructure-level vulnerabilities because they typically require the coordination of security teams with application development teams and require security managers to secure time from developers during already-cramped development and release schedules. In addition, fixes require changes to custom application code and application-specific business logic rather than the patches and configuration changes that are often sufficient to address infrastructure-level vulnerabilities. This presentation details many of the pitfalls organizations encounter while trying to manage application-level vulnerabilities as well as outlines strategies security teams can use for communicating with development teams. Similarities and differences between security teams’ practice of vulnerability management and development teams’ practice of defect management will be addressed in order to facilitate healthy communication between these groups.
