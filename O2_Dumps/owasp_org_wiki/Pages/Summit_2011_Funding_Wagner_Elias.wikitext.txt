| Personal_Request_Text = <!-- PUT THE REQUEST TEXT BELOW-->

I met the project in 2006. Then, studying secure development and guides was essential. In the same year I founded the Brazil chapter, which was recently split into regional chapters (Sao Paulo, Brasilia, Porto Alegre, Curitiba and Campinas). I lead the Sao Paulo chapter. Currently I'm constantly working with the resources and collaborating with OWASP disseminating the initiative in Brazil and working with projects like OWASP Fuzzing Code Database; ESAPI Swingset and participating in the organization AppSec Brazil.

I attended the Summit in 2008 and hope to participate in this one because it is a great opportunity to exchange information with the best professionals and see OWASP grow.
