=== Sept 25th 2008 - NYC CTF may get packaged up ===

There is a Capture-The-Flag (CTF) environment at the [http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_NYC_AppSec_2008_Conference NYC OWASP Con].  It seems likely that it will be packaged up and distributed.  Stay tuned...

== Desired Lab Components ==

 - WLAN WAP and/or big copper switches
 - host box with loads o' storage capable of running multiple victim VMs; capable of burning VMs to DVD
 - Proposal: I can provide a machine at the meetings that should work for what we are doing. It has a DVD burner, around a TB in storage space, and is fairly quick.
             I also have a Linksys wireless router that can be used. I am trying to get my hands on a large switch from our surplus, but haven't had any luck yet.
             I would be happy to bring it, just let me know.

 - Web App Firewall
 - IPS
 - CD/DVD copying capability

 - 2-factor auth for any management components; possibly for some of the target apps too...
 - Hamachi or some sort of VPN so we can stay decentralized...?
 - Somebody's open-source SEM/SIM to gather events so that the only time WAF/IPS/HIDS/HIPS/Whatever needs to be touched is for config changes
 - [http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_NYC_AppSec_2008_Conference NYC OWASP Con's] CTF environment with all of the above
