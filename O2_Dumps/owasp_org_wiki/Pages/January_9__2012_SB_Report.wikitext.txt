*[https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApZ9zE0hx0LNdENJNmo5SmxLcEg3MzVXZG9NVklEdUE&hl=en_US Chapter Activity Matrix] - used to inventory and manage information on local chapter activities and current leadership (ongoing maintenance required). Guidance provided by committee on October 17 call - "cleaning out" inactive chapters will be postponed until new chapter handbook released first of new year.
*Sent email to 38 chapter leaders who acknowledged chapter handbook (previous version) as part of OWASP Summit Transfer Request last January (2011), notifying them that according to their chapter wiki pages their chapter held or participated in less than 4 chapter meetings or events in 2011 (which was required in the previous version of the chapter handbook). Requested response and plans for upcoming year from leaders to see if they still want to continue as chapter leader, would like to step down, or need assistance.
** Assisted Chapters Committee with completing the revised [[Chapter Leader Handbook]] be end of 2011. Approved by both Chapter Committee and Global Board. Posted to wiki and currently coordinating translations to Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, and Russian.
* Drafted email and form to collect handbook acknowledgement from all chapter leaders (names collected from what is currently posted to all the chapter wiki pages).  Committee currently discussing whether they will ask for an optional financial plan for individual chapter funds for 2012.  Then will request all chapter leaders to acknowledge and agree to terms of new handbook and if existing funds, explain what is planned for funds. Goal is to send out email/form on Jan. 18 (with weekly reminders thereafter) and require response by end of February. A response is requested from each member of a chapter's leadership team  and if response not received by then, will assume leader is "opting out" of chapter leadership going forward.  If no responses are received for a chapter, chapter considered inactive and any funds will be donated to the foundation to support the Chapter Committee on a global scale.
* Work with Kate Hartmann to ensure that chapter-related requests through [http://sl.owasp.org/contactus Contact Us] Form are addressed in a timely fashion.
* Setting up new chapters -- @owasp.org email accounts, wiki page, mailing list, add to leader mailing list, and ensure chapter appears on regonline chapter list.
* Respond to various chapter leader questions/requests via email
* Manage OWASP merchandise requests via google doc, including business cards.
