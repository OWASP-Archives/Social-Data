*The [[:Category:OWASP Top Ten Project|'''OWASP Top Ten Project''']]'s project leader has invited M. Boberski to review the project against the [[Assessment Criteria v2.0|assessment criteria 2.0]]. 
**As a result, M. Boberski has raised a set of questions about the criteria. Please see them [http://docs.google.com/View?id=dcn8962c_63fgm7gbfd '''here'''].
**Dinis has built a FAQ wiki page to answer M.and to more broadly make our responses available for future assessment criteria's users. The FAQ wiki page can be accessed [[Assessment Criteria v2.0 FAQ|'''here''']].
**Please find the spare cycles to help to answer the above referred questions.

***Maybe the next phases of this process could consist in pushing it forward by using [[OWASP Project Reviewers Database|'''this page''']] to describe the review job role and, thereafter, by doing a call for reviewers through our leaders' mailing list.
