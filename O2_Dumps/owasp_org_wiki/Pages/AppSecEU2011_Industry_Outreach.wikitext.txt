The purpose for this session is to help organizations understand why application security is important and how OWASP can help in making their applications more secure. It will give them an opportunity to learn what documentation, training, architecture, tools and infrastructure is available. The best part is all these materials are free. OWSAP provides the solution for their application security needs. We are also looking to improve collaboration by helping get more organization participating in OWASP projects. This will help us ensure that we account for the various needs of industry and develop well vetted best practices.

=='''CISO Survey'''==
'''12:05-12:50 PM, Conference Day 2, 10 June 2011'''<br/>
'''Location: Arts Building room 3106'''

The objective of this session is to solicit feedback from industry leaders to help inform the content of the upcoming OWASP CISO survey.  Specifically, we are interested in what they would like to see in a survey of their peers and leaders and how they think such a survey should be executed.  The session will provide participants an opportunity to meet with peers in a vendor-free environment and discuss their problems with and solutions to information security.  It will also allow them to shape the focus of the upcoming survey to maximize the return value to them.

=='''Global Industry Roundtable'''==
'''15:00-15:45 PM, Conference Day 2, 10 June 2011'''<br/>
'''Location: Arts Building room 3106'''

This roundtable session will involve a series of questions aimed at driving discussion to determine: How can the OWASP Global Industry Committee become more relevant and work to achieve a better working relationship with industry verticals? What would types of OWASP resources (if none are currently available) would your company find value in? If you are not currently an OWASP member or corporate supporter, why not?  

The outcomes of this session, as well as similar sessions that we hope to host at the other OWASP global appsec conferences this year, will be used determine whether a new membership model (esp. for corporate supporters) is needed within OWASP as well as where committee resources should be focused in the upcoming year(s).
