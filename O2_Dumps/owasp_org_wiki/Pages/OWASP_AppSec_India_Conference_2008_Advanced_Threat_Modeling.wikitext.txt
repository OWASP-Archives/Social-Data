== Advanced Threat Modeling ==

To secure your home, you will first need to know how the thief could possibly enter and exit and where you should store your valuables. The same is true of your web applications. Unless you know what the vulnerabilities and threats of your web applications are, and what security measures you should take to protect them, ev1L h@x0rS or the enemy within (insider) could take advantage of the vulnerabilities. 

Threat Modeling is a technique that you can use to identify ATVS (attacks, threats, vulnerabilities and safeguards) that could affect your web applications. Threat Modeling helps in designing your application securely from a confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, authorization and auditing perspective. It is an essential activity to be undertaken during the design stage of your SDLC and helps mitigate and minimize overall risk.
