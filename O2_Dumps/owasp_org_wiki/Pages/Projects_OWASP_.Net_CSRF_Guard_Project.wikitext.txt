| project_home_page = .Net CSRF Guard

| project_description = It seems that the root cause of CSRF is cookie-based session IDs that get auto-sent by the browser with each request. What CSRFGuard (Java and this .Net version) therefore try to do is to allow one to continue using Cookie-based sessions by layering on top of this yet another session token that isn't sent in a cookie to essentially attempt to authenticate the HTML page contents and links as belonging to a legitimate session.
