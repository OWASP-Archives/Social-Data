First of all, thank you for visiting the OWASP website. I hope you found what you were looking for and find it to be a valuable resource. Thousands of others already have. Take the [[Top 10 2010|OWASP Top 10]] for example: the 2010 List has been viewed over 41,000 times since it went online in April. That's over 150 views every day--for a totally free resource created by volunteers. Volunteers who are experts in their fields and want nothing more than to make the Internet better and safer for everyone.
<br><br>
Now consider this: If even half the number of people who viewed the Top 10 donated just a dollar each, OWASP would be able to completely fund the travel expenses of about a dozen such volunteer experts to attend its [[Summit 2011|2011 Global Summit]]. Some of them are able to attend through funding from their respective companies, but many need assistance. The Summit isn't a conference, by the way: There are no lectures or training seminars--it's an opportunity to do actual work to further the field of application security. Participants even stay in shared accommodations to collaborate, producing tangible progress towards influencing standards, establishing road maps, and setting the tone for OWASP and application security for the coming years.
<br><br>
OWASP is [[About_OWASP#Tax_Status:_501.28c.29.283.29_Not-For-Profit_Organization|non-profit]]. It has already allocated all the financial resources it can to cover Summit attendees' expenses. But there are many more OWASP leaders who still need financial aid. ''Any'' amount you or your company/organization can contribute will directly help to make the Summit a success. ''Every'' dollar counts, and every additional leader that can attend the Summit because of contributions like yours will help OWASP continue to produce valuable resources like the Top 10 and keep them absolutely free for you to use.
<br><br>
Thank you for believing in OWASP's mission.
