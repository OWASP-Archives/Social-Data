== OWASP AppSec US 2009 Highlights ==
'''Ofer Maor, Hacktics
'''

In this lecture we will review the highlights of the last OWASP AppSec Conference in DC. We review some of the trends in application security, and updates to OWASP Projects. Among other topics, we will discuss the upcoming launch of the new OWASP Top 10 (2010), which is now in Release Candidate state, and reflects the changes in the spread of various application attacks.

== Decompilation Injection ==
'''Maty Siman, Checkmarx
'''

The presentation will show a novel way to protect .NET assemblies against reverse-engineering and recompilation. By injecting them with commands that are activated only at the recompilation stage, the application retroactively detects the reverse-engineering process and acts upon it.
