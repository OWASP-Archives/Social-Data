Talking points for the OWASP kick-off session 0900-0945 Day #1 and chapter leader session Day #1 7pm-8pm
<br><br>
NOTE - in a random order currently - please add to the list
<br><br>
#1 For local chapters we can address the handling of money has been solved with the testing and roll-out (in progress by Kate) of the paypal account that is now set-up - ALL local chapter sites (example see: http://www.owasp.org/index.php/NYNJMetro ) have the ability to process donations or ear mark money for reimbursement.  This eliminates the inability for OWASP Foundation to track/tally and provide governance/taxes over funds collected from sponsors at the local level and also allows any individual to start a chapter and remove the sticky handling money issue.
<br><br>
#2 We can also announce the FREE job posting board coming soon... any other global benefits to ensure that we announce at the kickoff?
