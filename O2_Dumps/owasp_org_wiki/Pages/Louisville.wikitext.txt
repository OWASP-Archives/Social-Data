==Announcement from OWASP Louisville Chapter - MEETING NOV 11TH - '''TOM ESTON''' TO SPEAK!!! ==
Meeting: Louisville OWASP - '''Nov 11th , 11:30 AM – 1 PM''' 

'''Meeting Location:''' 
Sullivan University Campus, 3101 Bardstown Road, Room 254, Louisville KY 40205 - (about 15 minutes from the airport…on I-264 East) 

When you arrive at the University's main building, Drive around past the front visitor's doors to the parking area on the right side of the Main Building. Room 254 can be accessed via a back stairway near a break area on the back right-hand side of the building, very easy to spot. 

'''Desktop Betrayal: Exploiting Clients through the Features They Demand''' 
In this talk, Tom Eston will explore the use of client features to gain privileged access to client systems. During previous talks around social networks, Tom Eston and fellow security researcher Kevin Johnson discovered that most of the damage they could perform against a target didn’t use an exploit against any vulnerable system. Tom and Kevin were able to create various attacks that made use of features being used on client machines. While this talk will not disclose any vulnerabilities within popular client software, Tom will be releasing multiple attacks that use these clients against their users. Tom will be discussing attacks using JavaScript, HTML5, PDF files, Flash, Data URIs, Web Workers and more. Tom will also discuss code to perform these attacks as well as add-ons to popular tools such as BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework) that will enable these tools to make use of the attacks. 

'''Tom Eston''' is the manager of the SecureState Profiling Team. Tom leads a team of highly skilled penetration testers that provides attack and penetration testing services for SecureState’s clients. Tom focuses much of his research on new technologies such as social media, mobile devices and new web technology. He is the founder of SocialMediaSecurity.com which is an open source community dedicated to exposing the insecurities of social media. Tom is also a security blogger, co-host of the Security Justice and Social Media Security podcasts and is a frequent speaker at security user groups and national conferences including DerbyCon, Notacon, OWASP AppSec, Black Hat USA, DEFCON and ShmooCon.

'''Speaker: Mike Zusman'''

Mike comes to us from the Intrepidus group and we are very lucky to have him. He’s a former web application developer turned computer security consultant. Mike is known for his speaking engagements at BlackHat, Defcon, CanSecWest, numerous OWASP events, and a number of other regional events. His research interests include mobile applications and platforms, remote access technologies, fuzzing, and SSL/TLS, but he currently has a sweet spot for automating web application attacks, identity management, and abusing social networks. 

Mike specializes in developing deep understandings of complex systems in a short period of time. Breaking software, and then documenting how he broke it. More importantly, he’s a skilled mountain biker, road cyclist, and snowboarder.

'''Please note: videos of our meetings are below in the presentations sections. We will try to take video of each meeting based on the speaker's permission. Demos may be omitted.'''

The January 2010 OWASP meeting featured a presentation from '''Rafal Los''' of HP.

'''''Speaker: Rafal Los on Flash and Web 2.0 security'''''

'''Rafal Los, Security Specialist with Hewlett-Packard's Application Security Center (ASC), is an industry veteran who has worked in a variety of security positions— from consultant to Information Security Officer in the Fortune 100— within some of the most demanding business environments. Rafal’s unique blend of technical expertise and business knowledge enable him to teach audiences about security techniques, programs and processes that they can both understand strategically, and realistically apply. He has extensive experience in security testing, risk analysis and management, penetration testing and architecture and policy. Previous successes include building and implementing a successful web application security program for one of the largest and most diverse companies in the world.'''



The third OWASP meeting featured a presentation from '''Rohyt Belani''' of Intrepidus Group. 

'''Along with being the CEO and co-founder of the Intrepidus Group, Rohyt is also Adjunct Professor at Carnegie Mellon University. Prior to starting the Intrepidus Group, Mr. Belani has held the positions of Managing Director at Mandiant, Principal Consultant at Foundstone and Researcher at the US-CERT. He is a contributing author for Osborne’s Hack Notes – Network Security, as well as Addison Wesley’s Extrusion Detection: Security Monitoring for Internal Intrusions. Mr. Belani is a regular speaker at various industry conferences including Black Hat, OWASP, ASIS, SecTOR, Hack in the Box, Infosec World, DallasCon, CPM, ISSA meetings, and several forums catering to the FBI, US Secret Service, and US Military. He has written technical articles and columns for online publications like Securityfocus and SC magazine, and has been interviewed by BBC Radio, Forbes magazine, TechNewsWorld, InformationWeek, Information Today, IndustryWeek, E-Commerce Times, SmartMoney, and Hacker Japan. Mr. Belani holds a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from Bombay University and a Master of Science in Information Networking from Carnegie Mellon University. He currently leads the OWASP Java Project a world-wide consortium of Java security experts.''' 

Please see the description from Rohyt on his presentation on the 18th. 

'''''Site takedown services, anti-phishing filters, and millions of dollars worth of protective technologies…..and the spear phishers are still successful! This presentation will discuss why this is the case. Today, phishing is a key component in a “hackers” repertoire. Phishers are combining social engineering with application security flaws in well known websites to make automated detection of targeted phishing attacks almost impossible. The result - hijacked online brokerage accounts, stolen identities and e-bank robberies. During this talk, I will present the techniques used by attackers to execute such spear phishing attacks, and real-world cases that I have responded to that will provide perspective on the impact. I will then discuss countermeasures that have been proven to be effective and are recommended by reputed bodies like SANS and Carnegie Mellon University.'''''


The second OWASP meeting will featured a presentation from '''Adrian Crenshaw of Irongeek'''. Adrian is a Louisville based Security professional that has worked in the IT industry for the last twelve years. 

'''Adrian runs the  information security website Irongeek.com, which specializes in videos and  articles that illustrate how to use various pen-testing and security tools. He's currently working on an MBA, but is interested in getting a network security/research/teaching job in academia. Please see the description from Adrian on his presentation on the 19th.''' 

[[Title:]] '''Mutillidae: Using a deliberately vulnerable set of PHP scripts to illustrate the OWASP Top 10''' 

'''''Description: A while back I wanted to start covering more web application pen-testing tools and concepts in some of my videos and live classes. Of course, I needed vulnerable web apps to illustrate common web security problems. I like the WebGoat project, but sometimes it's a little hard to figure out exactly what they want you to do to exploit a given web application, and it's written in J2EE (not a layman friendly language).  In an attempt to have something simple to use as a demo in my videos and in class, I started the Mutillidae project. Mutillidae is a deliberately vulnerable set of PHP scripts meant to illustrate the OWASP Top 10. This talk will cover installing Mutillidae in a test environment, and how to use it to illustrate the OWASP Top 10 web vulnerabilities in easy to understand terms.'''''



March 2009

'''The first Louisville OWASP meeting was launched with the help of the Kentuckiana ISSA Chapter, on Friday March 6 2009. The Louisville OWASP chapter is closely associated with the Kentuckiana ISSA chapter and will offer ISSA members, other security professionals, application developers, and all other interested parties, a free forum to learn and discuss the newest developments in application security. Following March’s meeting, we will meet quarterly on a different day and time. The information on future meetings will be following soon. Please provide feedback to the board.'''


Everyone is welcome to join us at our chapter meetings.
