=== Draft Text version 1 ===

==== Introduction ====

This official response has been submitted on behalf of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) by the OWASP Global Industry Committee, following our own consultation process.

==== Response ====

The OWASP response only replies to two questions.

'''6. Is the code relevant to the types of data sharing your organisation is involved in? If not, which additional areas should we cover?'''

In "Technical Security" on page 15, there is no mention of websites, yet these are one of the common channels that lead to personal data breaches.  Our suggestion is to add an item:
"If personal data is collected or processed using a web site or mobile application, have the most common security risks been identified, removed or mitigated?"

This could reference as footnotes, or in other supporting materials, the following free guidance documents:
* [http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project#tab=Main OWASP Top Ten - The Ten Most Critical Web Application Security Risks] and further guidance contained therein
* [http://projects.webappsec.org/Threat-Classification WASC Threat Classification] 
* [http://www.sans.org/top25-software-errors/ CWE/SANS TOP 25 Most Dangerous Software Errors]

'''10. Is there anything else you think the code should cover or are there any other ways in which you think the code could be improved?'''

In "technical security" on page 15, we believe "is your information encrypted" is too simplistic.  Many difficulties exist in implementing encryption properly and problems can be introduced in unexpected ways.  Whilst we understand this document cannot provide all the detail required, a better question would be "How is encryption implemented and managed?"

On page 17 in the discussion of data standards, non-Latin characters are mentioned, but the more generic issues of encoding (e.g. UTF-8) and escaping are not.  These are significant factors in successful data sharing and for ensuring the integrity of the data once it has been exported from one system and imported into another.  If not properly defined and implemented, data that is safe in one system might actively exploit a weakness in another leading to data loss, destruction, etc (e.g. by SQL injection).  Our suggestion is to add after "capabilities of its system.", a new sentence "Ensure the data are correctly encoded and escaped when output so they can safely be used by the receiving system.".
