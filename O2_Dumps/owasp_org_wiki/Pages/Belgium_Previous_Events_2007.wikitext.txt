===PROGRAM===
The agenda:

* 18h00 - 18h30: Welcome, Pizza and drinks<BR>
* 18h30 - 18h45: Sebastien Deleersnyder, OWASP BeLux<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''OWASP Update'''<BR>
* 18h45 - 19h00: Tomas Vanhoof, ISSA<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''ISSA Intro'''<BR>
* 19h00 - 20h00: Patrick Debois<BR>
:'''Operational security impact on developing secure applications'''
:As an experienced programmer you are well experienced in applying the OWASP guidelines. At least we hope so ;-) Still we are ainly involved :within the creation of the application during a project phase. But good security management goes beyond that one phase, enter the operational security. Not having programming skills, these operationalunits over the years have created several security layers around the applications. Think firewalls, intrusion detection, prevention, antivirus systems... These server and network oriented security measures more and more influence application deployment and can also benefit from better application integration.
:This presentation will show you the impact of f.i. central logmanagement, patch management, identity & access management, loadbalancing, antivirus ..  can have on the application deployment and how with little modification of our application it can make a whole world of difference to the security in the trenches. They will be complementary to the OWASP set of guidelines. Also developers will get a better understanding of an additional set of non-functional requirements that are security related.
:'''Patrick Debois''' has been an independent consultant for 15 years and is fascinated by the transition of a projects into operational mode. In order to better understand this interaction, he frequently changes his role from being a project manager, systems engineer, tester and developer.
:His  two main technical point of interests are:
:* portal, cms, dms, search (f.i. brussels airport, eurocontrol,www.vrtnieuws.net) 
:*identity/access management: (f.i. ministry of Finance, flemish government, telenet).
:Complementary to these technical skills, he stimulates the human factor within projects by using both coaching (NLP) and project manamagement skils(Lean, Scrum).In his latest assignment he is experimenting with Scrum and Coaching within an operational team.
* 20h00 - 20h15: break
* 20h15 - 21h15: Herman Stevens & Swa Frantzen, NET2S<BR>
:'''Security awareness programs for development'''
:Security awareness programs for developers are an effective tool to improve not just the security but can be used as a vehicle to improve efficiency in the development cycle just as well. This talk gives an overview of what the different roles in a development department need to know and introduces some key concepts in order to make such a program a success. Real examples from actual security awareness trainings will be given as well. 
:'''Swa Frantzen''' first encountered the Internet in its very early days at the KULeuven as a system administrator at the Computer Science department. Ever since he developed an active interest in the security consequences of that network of networks. Swa served in different functions at different levels between engineering and management in the security service industry (Ubizen, Telindus, SANS, NET2S) and the telecommunications world (EUnet, Scarlet). Currently he is an independent security consultant. He is also one of the handlers at the SANS Internet Storm Center.
:'''Herman Stevens''' (CISA, CISSP) works in the information security field since nearly a decade. At Smals-MvM he developed applications regarding the Belgian social security system. He started at Ubizen as the security product trainer, and later was asked to become information security consultant. The bulk of his work became doing risk assessments, creating security policies, performing PCI audits and especially application security related work such as application security reviews, penetration testing, code review and training developers. Currently he works as a senior consultant at NET2S, where he focuses on security awareness training for development teams.

==== OWASP Evaluation and Certification Criteria Draft (Mark Curphey) ====
Download [[:Image:OWASP_Day_-_Belgium_-_Curphey.pdf|presentation]].

As opposed to me continuing saying what’s wrong with PCI DSS, it seems to me that OWASP is a perfect forum to simply create and publish a “better criteria”. This can either be adopted and implemented by an organization like OWASP or considered to be incorporated into the PCI or other security standards. We won't get bogged down in the politics up-front, but hold something good up to the world for people to adopt. This project would of course draw on and bring together many of the other OWASP Projects including the Guide (What is a secure web app), Testing Guides (How to test for a secure web app), WebGoat (part of how to certify an individual understands and can find web app issues) etc. Many of those projects may not be complete or a perfect fit today, but this project can bring a common connecting theme to a lot of very valuable IP that OWASP has built over the years. I will also create it in such as way that a corporate could adopt/adapt it themseles as well as an industry. Where other OWASP projects are not complete or currently suitable I will build a requirements doc that can be considered by those teams if they feel appropriate.

==== CLASP, SDL and Touchpoints Compared (Bart De Win) ====
Download [[:Image:OWASPDay2007Belgium_BartDeWin.ppt|presentation]].

Over the years, specific methodologies and techniques for secure software 
engineering have been proposed, yet dedicated processes have become available 
only recently. In this presentation, the highlights of an activity-driven 
comparison of three high-profile processes for the development of secure 
software are presented.

Bart De Win is a postdoctoral researcher in the research group DistriNet, Department of Computer Science at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven.

He holds master degrees in criminology and information technology.

==== For my next trick... hacking Web2.0 (pdp) ====
Download [[:Image:OWASP_Day_Belgium_2007-pdp.ppt|presentation]].

Web2.0, if I can summarize it with a few simple words, is all about communication, distribution, information, agents, clients and servers. Those who understand the 2.0 fundamentals have the power to manipulate the global Web to suit their needs - hackers, the new digital breed of the 2.0 world. Web2.0 hacking is a mean for communicating and distributing critical information in a better way. It can be used to build ghost infrastructures from where to launch attacks - anonymously, no traces, nothing. Web2.0 hacking is also about the thin line between client-side and server-side security. It is about the endpoints and the electronic highways. It is about reaching the masses and yet being able to perform attacks on specific targets. Web2.0 hacking is also about distribution and influence, covert channels, bots, IA, ghosts inside the electronic frame. Web2.0 hacking is also a movement, a cyber subculture where individuals show their technical abilities, and understandings of the world and use that to manipulate their way through the system.

Web2.0 hacking practices should never be related to AJAX and JavaScript exploitation techniques only. Although it is true that client-side security has a significant part of the Web2.0 ecosystem, it is important to realize its role. There are far too many other aspects that we need to look into. My aim is to cover these aspects and reveal the hidden dangers.

:Several research tracks focus on tools and techniques to verify or guarantee the absence of implementation bugs in web applications, either at compile-time or at run-time. By guaranteeing the absence of certain implementation bugs, the reliability and security of the application can be improved. In this presentation, we will focus on the absence of implementation bugs due to broken data dependencies.
:Web applications typically share non-persistent session data between different parts of the application, e.g. a shopping cart in a e-commerce application. By doing so, implicit dependencies arise between the different parts of the application, and breaking these dependencies in an application may result in information leakage of erroneous behavior.
:In our research, we explicitly model dependencies between components that indirectly share data. Next, we verify that in a given composition these dependencies are not broken by applying a combination of static verification and dynamic checking (e.g. by using a Web Application Firewall).
:We validated the presented approach in two existing applications: a Struts-based, open-source webmail application (GatorMail) and an e-commerce site (Duke's BookStore from the J2EE 1.4 tutorial).

:'''Lieven Desmet''' Lieven Desmet was born on January 16, 1979 in Roeselare. He received a Bachelor of Applied Sciences and Engineering degree and graduated magna cum laude in Master of Applied Sciences and Engineering: Computer Science from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in July 2002.

Over the last decade, Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP), a development paradigm that focuses on improving the modularisation of crosscutting concerns, has received a great deal of attention from the academic as well as from the industrial community. In the context of secure software development, AOP has been shown to bring a number of benefits, at least from a software engineering perspective. From a security perspective, the characteristics of AOP have been studied less. One of the key questions at this moment is whether we can really use AOP to build \emph{secure} software ?<BR>
In this presentation we will address this key question by elaborating on a number of security implications of AOP. Risks will be shown to originate from the core concepts of AOP, as well as from tool-specific implementation strategies (with a specific focus on AspectJ). The presentation will be concluded by indicating how these risks could be mitigated, both from a theoretical and from a practical perspective.<BR>
