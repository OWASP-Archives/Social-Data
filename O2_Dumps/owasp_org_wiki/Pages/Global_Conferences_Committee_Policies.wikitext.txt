| Local host chapters will share in OWASP event profits under the following schedule.  In the case of multiple host chapters, the host chapters will be responsible for determining the division before the event.
* Global AppSec Conference - 25% of event profits with a $5,000 USD cap ($10,000 for multi-chapter events)
* Regional/Theme Events - 30% of event profits with a $4,000 USD cap
* Local Events - 50% of profits with a $3000 USD cap
| In addition to the  Membership Committee membership split that provides funds to local chapters, it is also appropriate to allow local chapters to leverage the hard work that goes into planning events as additional revenue streams.  The committee considered weighing the needs of the OWASP Foundation, Local Chapters entrepreneurship, the desire not to create "haves and have not" chapters within OWASP in addition to many other factos when setting this policy.
