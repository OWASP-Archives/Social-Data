I am a bit confused why MS06-034 is marked with 'Remote Code Execution' since if we follow the same logic, then MS should also release an advisory called "Asp.Net allows Remote Code Execution"


== Research questions ==

* where are the vulnerabilities (any volunteers to reverse engineer the patches?)
** [http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-034.mspx MS06-034] should be on asp.dll
** [http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-033.mspx MS06-033] should be on the config files?
* can the other dislosed vulnerabilites be expoited from an ASP.NET environment, namely
