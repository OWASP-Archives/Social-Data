'''Wednesday, April 25, 2012 - 5:00pm - South Florida OWASP Meeting - Two great talks and networking after'''

Join us for our February meeting where in alignment with our previous announcement, we will have two great talks. Please note that food and drink after the meeting will also be sponsored by DBNetworks and OWASP. 

''Talk 1: How is static analysis is like hunting foxes in the forest?''

A brief guide to tools assisted secure code review.  Includes a discussion of challenges and recommendations to make your work in static analysis and secure code review more effective.

Sean has over 5 years of hands on experience using the Ounce/AppScan Source product.  He holds a B.S. in Computer Science from Principia College.


''Talk 2: SQL Injection''

New reports of SQL injection attacks, on corporate databases, are appearing almost weekly.  Applications free from vulnerabilities are always the best defense, but a better backstop is clearly needed since existing solutions are unable to defend against this threat.  DBNetworks will present its vision for a future technology which will protect against new and unique SQL injection attacks in real-time.

Presenter Bio:

'''Thursday. February 23, 2012 - 5:00pm - South Florida OWASP Meeting - Two great talks and networking after'''

Join us for our February meeting where in alignment with our previous announcement, we will have two great talks. Please note that food and drink after the meeting will also be sponsored by WhiteHat. 

''Talk 1: Future of Cross Site Scripting defenses''

This talk will discuss the past methods used for cross-site scripting (XSS) defense that were only partially effective. Learning from these lessons, we will also discuss present day defensive methodologies that are effective, but place an undue burden on the developer. We will then finish with a discussion of future XSS defense mythologies that shift the burden of XSS defense from the developer to various frameworks. These include auto-escaping template technologies, browser-based defenses such as Content Security Policy, and Javascript sandboxes such as the Google CAJA project and JSReg.

Presenter Bio:
Jim Manico is the VP of Security Architecture for WhiteHat Security, a web security firm.  Jim is a participant and project manager of the OWASP Developer Cheatsheet series. He is also the producer and host of the OWASP Podcast Series.

Join us for our July meeting where we will be discussing the latest release of one of the most formidable web application attack tools currently available: SQLMap0.9

The meeting will discuss some basic methods of SQL injection vulnerability identification (both error based and blind), and will go over ways to use the SQLMap0.9 tool to test your web application. Futhermore, we will discuss some of the more advanced features of SQLMap that were unavailable in previous releases.

Automated Scanning and Differential Reporting

Companies are struggling with scaling source code scanning, there are not enough security experts to fulfill the current demand.  Developers are being overwhelmed with the quantity and quality of issues reported from misconfigured scanning tools.  This session will present an automated source code scanning deployment methodology that allows organizations to automatically reduce false positives during scanning and deliver reports that represent the high confidence security risk of the latest software changes.  

What will your audience walk away with?
1) Establishment of security policies is key to reducing false positives
2) Automated scanning is easy to configure and requires limited maintenance
3) Differential reporting reduces developer overload by highlighting the risk of recent  change

'''Thurs. March 17, 2011 - 3:30pm - South Florida OWASP Meeting + ISSA Meeting'''

South Florida OWASP is teaming up with South Florida ISSA to bring you a very special St. Patricks Day meeting. There will be an after-party sponsored by Barracuda in Boca.
 
We will have two great talks: Edward Bonver from Symantec will speak on Threat Modeling followed by Grant Murphy from Barracuda presenting their latest research: The State of Web Application Security.
 
This meeting will be held from 3:30pm - 5:30pm at NCCI Holdings, Inc in Boca Raton and the party, sponsored by Barracuda, will be at the Dubliner.

Dubliner
435 Plaza Real
Boca Raton, FL
 
Talk: Threat Modeling
Threat Modeling is one of the most important security activities that a development/QA team needs to perform as part of a Security Development Lifecycle. This activity allows the team to build a complete security profile of the system being built. Threat Modeling is not always easy to get going for a team that has little or no security experience. In this presentation we'll take a look at why Threat Modeling is so important; we'll explore the process behind it, and how the process is being implemented and followed across Symantec.

He holds a master's degree in computer science from California State University, Northridge, and a bachelor's degree in computer science from Rochester Institute of Technology. Edward is a Ph.D. student at NOVA Southeastern University.
 
Talk: The State of Web Application Security
It's no secret that more and more commerce is being conducted via Web applications. Web-based applications are convenient for consumers and allow vendors to get applications online quickly to reach those consumers. This trend has also created a variety of privacy and security concerns that affect all companies transacting business over the Web.  Recently, Barracuda networks co-sponsored a research study conducted by the Ponemon Institute titled "The State of Web Application Security" that revealed that these concerns are keenly felt by web application administrators.  However, a major disconnect exists as appropriate countermeasures to these threats are either ineffective or completely non-existent.  Join us for an informative seminar to learn:

More about our revealing research,

Why Web applications are under attack,

What hackers are doing to compromise Web applications

How to mitigate this risk.

Bio: Grant Murphy, Vice President of Enterprise Solutions, Barracuda Networks 
Grant Murphy is Vice President of Enterprise Solutions managing worldwide sales for the Barracuda Web Application Firewall and the Web Filtering products at Barracuda Networks.

<br>
The primary aim of the OWASP Top 10 is to educate developers, designers, architects and organisations about the consequences of the most important web application security weaknesses. ESAPI is Enterprise security API's for remediation of OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. The ESAPI libraries are designed to make it easier for programmers to retrofit security into existing applications. 
<br>
The ESAPI Swingset is a web application which demonstrates common security vulnerabilities and asks users to secure the application against these vulnerabilities using the ESAPI libraries. The application is intended for Java Developers. The goal of the application is to teach developers about the functionality of the ESAPI libraries and give users a practical understanding of how it can be used to protect web applications against common security vulnerabilities.
