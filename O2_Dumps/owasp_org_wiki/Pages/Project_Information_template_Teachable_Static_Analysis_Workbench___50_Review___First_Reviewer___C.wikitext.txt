# TeSA plugin allows the user to mark the sources and sinks in the Eclipse text editor.  
# FindBugs plugin was written which performs tainted analysis in more precise way than LAPSE, but does not yet have a  GUI. 
# A command "ant run-tests" can be run from the command-line which consists of unit-tests for generating FindBugs configuration files that can then be reviewed using FindBugs.

# Change the Install Guide on the Wiki to refer to the specific versions of Eclipse, FindBugs, e.g., FindBugs 1.3.4, Eclipse 3.4 JEE 
# Modify the Install Guide to say that in editing the build.properties file, it is necessary to use forward slashes for the directory paths even on Windows. 
# Add the download location for the secbugs subtree to the Install Guide, i.e. http://code.google.com/p/teachablesa/source/browse/#svn/trunk/secbugs 
# To support the esapi-demo-app in the Project Technical Report Draft, add the URL path for downloading the demo application to the Install Guide, i.e., http://code.google.com/p/teachablesa/source/browse/#svn/trunk/webapps/esapi_demo_app 
# Update the Install Guide to download Ant from apache.org for running the "ant run-tests" command. 
# Update the Install Guide to download Tomcat from apache.org for satisfying the esapi-demo-app dependencies in Eclipse for the servlet-api.jar file. 
# In the User's Guide Step 5, you need to right-click in the "Lapse View Sources" to select "Find Sources".  
# The Install Guide or User's Guide has be updated with instructions for viewing the results of the "ant run-tests" with FindBugs.
