1. At what extent have the project deliveries & objectives been accomplished?  Having in consideration [[OWASP Summer of Code 2008 Applications - Need Futher Clarifications#GTK+ GUI for w3af project|'''the assumed ones''']], please exemplify writing down those of them that haven't been realised.

1.  The project is fully completed, finished on schedule and Facundo did an excellent job.  A detailed progress can be seen in the w3af sourceforge project page [https://sourceforge.net/pm/task.php?group_id=170274&set=custom&group_project_id=56282&_assigned_to=0&_status=2&SUBMIT=Browse here] and a list of the bugs that were found and fixed during the development can be found [https://sourceforge.net/tracker2/?group_id=170274&atid=853652 here].

In [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Project_Information:template_GTK_plus_GUI_for_w3af_Project_-_Final_Review_-_Self_Evaluation_-_B Facundo's self revision] he listed the task IDs for every task, I analyzed them and he correctly listed the ones that were finished (which are all the ones that are assigned to him). An important thing to note is that some of this tasks weren't planned at the beggining of the project, but included after it, in response to community or project leader request (the idea is not to minimize the work, but to maximize the tool quality and usefulness). Once again, Facundo's work has been excellent.

2. At what extent have the project deliveries & objectives been accomplished?  Having in consideration [[OWASP Summer of Code 2008 Applications - Need Futher Clarifications#GTK+ GUI for w3af project|'''the assumed ones''']], please quantify in terms of percentage.
 | colspan="2" style="width:75%; background:#cccccc" align="left"|
A 100% of the project was completed. And as I said before, Facundo also performed some '''extra''' tasks, so I could also say 110%.

To Facundo: I'm glad you learned to code without an API ;)
