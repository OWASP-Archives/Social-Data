1. At what extent have the project deliveries & objectives been accomplished?  Having in consideration [[OWASP Summer of Code 2008 Applications#Online code signing and integrity verification service for open source community (OpenSign Server)|'''the assumed ones''']], please exemplify writing down those of them that haven't been realised.

* Client tool to generate RSA key pair and request signing certificate by return via a secure connection, secure connection will authenticate user after a dedicated registration process and also use mutual authentication SSL to avoid man-in-the-middle - returning certificate to user in real time. Registered developer can then submit their SPC online to verify the SPC.

-> ok

* Client tool to download software that will do a proper verification on the software against the code signing service

-> code download and verification is not available in the OSSJClient. Verification of the certificate is therefore performed
independently of the signed code (one step is missing in the process).

* Website interface for the code signing service

-> ok

* Set of Admin tools to manage the code signing service, user and certificate repository

-> available, but completeness of features should be validated

* Documentation

-> User documentation has been completed.

-> The demonstration could be more explicit related to the integration of the tools in the software deployment process.
The role of entities (certificate, CSR) could be explained more precisely, so as to enable developpers with limited 
security knowledge to use the tool. For instance: integrate the documentation (opendsign-concept.doc ...) in the
demo slides.

Documentation in the code repository contains the original design doc rather than the current dev/use documentation.

'''Second comments''':

* I was able to get this running fine on MS OS with Java/Maven and compile in the Eclipse IDE
* it would be nice it it would be possible to simply download and run the code
for the server and the client  - AGREE
* available user documentation: what can I do with each tool, how (for instance under the form of a '5 minutes introduction' and reference list of available functions) ? - AGREE
* I would like to see the C# version as well
* it would be nice if the 'trunk' would be documented in a way that let the user know:
* how to run the server and clients (a global 'readme' file is missing).
* Moreover, the 'opensign-design' document could be completed. User documentation makes this less urgent. - Agree

'''Final Review'''

Extending the OSSJClient with code download and verification feature would provide a important added value for
a reasonnable work overhead. It could therefore be done in priority.
