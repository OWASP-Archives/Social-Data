Here are some frequently-asked questions about the [http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Commercial_Services OWASP Commercial Services registry]:

'''Question: What do you need from us?'''

''Answer:'' For each type of service (Verification, Implementation Services, Process Improvement, and Training), one has to first choose what services of a given type one is offering. For example, for Verification, one can choose from any combination of ASVS levels 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3, 4. Next, one has to provide the information requested in the paragraph above the table, let's keep using Verification as an example, starting from the second half of the paragraph: "Provider listings are required to include the following information..." -- this sentence provides a list of the information needed. The "Acme Application Security Co." is a fictional company listing that provides an example of a listing that provides the needed information.

'''Question: How many categories can we be listed under (we fall under a couple)'''

''Answer:'' You can be listed once for each type of service (Verification, Implementation Services, Process Improvement, and Training). So, one company could have up to four listings, one on each tab. Then, in each listing, one can include one or more specific services of that type. The "Acme Application Security Co." is a fictional company on the Verification tab for example provides both ASVS Level 1A and 1B verification services.
