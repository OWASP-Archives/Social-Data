== '''What is the Chapter Leader Workshop?'''  ==

On '''Wednesday, November 9, 2011 at 2:30pm-5:30pm''' the Global Chapter Committee is organizing a chapter leader workshop for all the chapter leaders that attend the conference. ''Please note that this Workshop will take place on the day before the Conference starts.'' 

<br>'''Items that will be discussed are:''' 

*How to improve the current Chapter Leader Handbook? 
*How to start and support new chapters within the Asia/Pacific region? 
*How to support inactive chapters in the Asia/Pacific region? 
*What Governance model is required for OWASP chapters? 
*How can the Global Chapters Committee facilitate the Asian OWASP chapters? 
*...

<br>Additionally we hope to make time and space available to do hands-on work revising the [[Chapter Leader Handbook]], details TBA. 

<br> 

== '''Funding to Attend the Workshop'''  ==

If you need financial assistance to attend the Chapter Leader Workshop at AppSec Asia, please submit a request to [mailto:tin.zaw@owasp.org Tin Zaw] and [mailto:sarah.baso@owasp.org Sarah Baso] by '''September 15, 2011'''. 

<br>Funding for your attendance to the workshop should be worked out in the following order. 

#Ask your employer to fund your trip to AppSec Asia conference. 
#Utilize your chapter funds. 
#Ask the chapter committee for funding assistance.

<br>While we wish we could fund every chapter leader, due to the limited amount of budget allocated for this event, we may not be able to fund 100% to all the requests. After September 15, we will make funding decision in a fair and transparent manner. When you apply for funding, please highlight your past contributions to OWASP and your future plans for the local chapter and OWASP.
