Some thoughts and the things I would like to do/achieve in the GIC:

To start, I like to strengthen more our work towards decision makers and developers. It may sound simple as it is only 20 pages, but I loved the "OWASP Secure Coding Practices - Quick Reference Guide". Simple and yet easy to use for an industry company.
The OWASP for CIO document/presentation has potential to be equally useful. As well, I hope we can improve and build on the AppSec for CISO guide Marco is currently working on, at least that is something I will spend significant time on myself.

We should also tailor a bit of our messages a bit more towards industry. And build corporate memberships. 
For our conferences, IMHO we should try to strengthen our industry related tracks and message.

In the past we missed sometimes to connect to developers (and that is IMHO also due to the fact that we missed to connect to the industry as the main consumer where actually most of the developers sit).

Just my 5cents. Am open, so if you have further suggestions/ideas, please let me know. 

Tobias

I look forward to working with him again.
