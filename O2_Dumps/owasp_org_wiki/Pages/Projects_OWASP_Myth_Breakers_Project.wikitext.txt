| project_home_page = OWASP Myth Breakers Project

| project_description = Similar to http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/mythbusters but for appsec, urban legends and assumptions regarding appsec will be tested and there'll be a set of examples that will prove the correctness/incorrectness of a statement related to the question. Every question will be answered in the mailing list and further, a page on the OWASP site will be created to report the results. Also anyone will be able to use the contents of the page/ml in OWASP conferences to spread the verb about what's an urban legend and what's not‚Äù.
