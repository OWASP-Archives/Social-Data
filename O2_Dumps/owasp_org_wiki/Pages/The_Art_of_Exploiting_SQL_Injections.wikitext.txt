__NOTOC__ 
==Description==
'''Course Length: 1 Day'''

This is a full day hands on training course which will typically target penetration testers, security auditors/administrators  and even web developers  to learn advanced exploitation techniques. SQL Injection, although now nearly 15 years old, still exists in over 30% of the web applications. This vulnerability could typically result in 3 scenarios:

# Authentication Bypass
# Extraction of arbitrary sensitive data from the database
# Access and compromise of the internal network.

To identify the true impact of this vulnerability it is essential that the vulnerability gets exploited to the full extent. While there is a reasonably good awareness when it comes to identify this problem, there are still a lot of grey areas when it comes to exploitation or even identifying complex vulnerabilities like a 2nd order injections. This training will target 3 databases (MS-SQL, Mysql, Oracle) and discuss a variety of exploitation techniques to exploit each scenario. The aim of the training course is to address the following:

# Identify the most complicated sql injections which are beyond the scope of any automated tool?
# Identify and Extract sensitive data from back-end database?
# Privilege Escalation  within the database and extracting data with database admin privilege?
# OS code execution on these database server and use this as a pivot to attack internal network?

==Student Requirements==
Students will need to bring a laptop with VMWare

==Objectives==
Skill: Basic, Intermediate

# Understand the problem of SQL Injection 
# Learn a variety of advanced exploitation techniques which hackers use.
# How to fix the problem?
