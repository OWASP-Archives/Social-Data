===Overview===
The start of [[OWASP_Internationalization | OWASP Internationalization]] project is great opportunity to make Spanish the first language on which the OWASP site and documentation is fully translated and at the same time share the experience with other people interested in the same objective, Bring OWASP to the world.  And this is something I’ve being pushing for some time ago and that could be possible “at once” via [[OWASP_Summer_of_Code_2008_Applications | SoC]] 2008.

I understand this is significant effort, but OWASP-Spanish started on 2005 so we have a good amount of contributors from since then, Also local chapters from Spanish speaking countries like [[Spain | spain]], are very willing to make this happen :).
