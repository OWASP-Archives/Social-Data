*18h00 - 18h45: Welcome &amp; Pizzas<br> 
*18h45 - 19h00: '''OWASP Update ([https://www.owasp.org/images/c/c9/Owasp_Belgium_update_2012-03-06.pptx PPT])''' (by Sebastien Deleersnyder, SAIT Zenitel, OWASP Board)<br> 
*19h00 - 20h00: '''Common iOS Pitfalls vs. OWASP's iGoat ([https://www.owasp.org/images/c/c3/Appsecusa2011-bechapterbyKen-owasptop10mobilerisks.pptx PPT])''' (by Ken van Wyk, KRvW Associates)<br>
:In this session, Ken will spotlight and demonstrate several security "gotchas" in Apple's iOS platform (iPhone and iPad). He'll then introduce the OWASP iGoat tool and demonstrate how it can be used (and extended) to help train iOS coders. Like the other OWASP *Goat tools, iGoat is a great learning platform that can help iOS developers internalize the big issues they face in building bulletproof apps. Ken is the project leader for iGoat, and we're always looking for contributors.

:Access Control is a necessary security control at almost every layer within a web application. This talk will discuss several of the key access control anti-patterns commonly found during website security audits. These access control anti-patterns include hard-coded security policies, lack of horizontal access control, and "fail open" access control mechanisms. In reviewing these and other access control problems, we will discuss and design a positive access control mechanism that is data contextual, activity based, configurable, flexible, and deny-by-default - among other positive design attributes that make up a robust web-based access-control mechanism.
:'''Jim Manico''' is the VP of Security Architecture for WhiteHat Security, a web security firm.  Jim is a participant and project manager of the OWASP Developer Cheatsheet series. He is also the producer and host of the OWASP Podcast Series.

:This talk will summarize the different ideas behind devops, and will show that this goes beyond tooling and becomes a way of thinking, where ultimately everybody  will stand together to support the business.
:Some call this phenomenon devops, others hate the word and want to call it *ops or ops* ,  truth is that agile techniques used in development have an impact on the way operations organizes it work.  Similar, operations and sysadmins are becoming programmers because of the virtualization and automation trend where everything is managed through an API.    And security is imvolved everywhere.

:During this presentation we give an overview of how we can harden web applications against different types of attacks used by malware to bypass the existing security controls in the web application. We discuss the OWASP Top 10 and how malware can abuse these attacks and how the developer must implement a different strategy. We explain why (mobile) browser security is an important aspect of web application hardening and most importantly that the battle against malware is an ongoing battle. For every countermeasure the security industry develops to protect web applications and is used by a lot of companies today we will show how malware is being developed to bypass these solutions. To finalize we give some advice on how to protect against these malware attacks, using pro-active and detective controls.
