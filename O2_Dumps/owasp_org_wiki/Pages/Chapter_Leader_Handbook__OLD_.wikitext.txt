[[Category:Chapter_Handbook]]

'''Note: this is the OLD chapter handbook. The new [[:Category:Chapter_Handbook|chapter handbook]] is being written by the [[Global Chapter Committee|global chapter committee]] and expected to be ready in Q2 2009.
'''

This handbook aims to guide new and experienced OWASP Chapter leaders in starting and maintaining an active chapter community. It outlines items that the [[NYNJMetro|NY/NJ Metro Local Chapter]] has done to be successful in its market.

==Identifying the Chapter Board==
On your chapter page, ensure you clearly identify who is on the board of the chapter, including their phone numbers and/or email addresses. The Local Chapter should have a published mailing address. Use a PO Box or one of the board member's (company's) addresses, perhaps.

It is highly recommended to have at a min. (2) chapter leaders and there are is no limit... in NYC there are 10 chapter leaders and each have a role in the success of the chapter so work with your peers being a chapter leader requires 10+ hrs per month and we are all BUSY

==Generating Interest==
* Talk to local higher education institutions. Involve the university and its computer science students&mdash;you might even get access to their lab!
* Talk to the local chapters of information security organizations. For example, [http://www.issa.org/ ISSA], [http://www.isaca.org/ ISACA], [http://www.infragard.net/ FBI/Infragard], [http://www.htcia.org/ HTCIA] and other local and international organizations. Cross-promote and/or join meetings, be a guest speaker and host guest speakers.
* Use OWASP chapter [http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo mailing lists] to alert members of meetings and monthly events.
* Conduct an annual survey (use a web form) to get feedback from the mailing list/chapter members&mdash;what do they want to see in your chapter?
* Ask for help. A successful chapter has several board members (there are no limits) so share the fun and the pain. &smiley;
* Do a local talk about OWASP [[Projects]] that you have been involved with.

==(Re-)Starting Your Chapter==
A sample action plan that you can use is:
* Find a location/venue sponsor for a first meeting. This could be a college, a business, a restraunt...
* Enable sponsorship for refreshments from a local source.
* Always cover the OWASP [[About OWASP|mission and goals]]. Explain the web application security problem in a general way to attract a large crowd and to educate the new members and guests.
* Send out an invitation/announcement and also try to let other local security organizations know about the meeting as well. These can be local ISSA, ASIS, Infragard, ISACA or other chapters.
* Try to get some local press attention&mdash;free press is great.
* Hook up with government and academic contacts in your area to relay the invitation and generate some interest.
* Find out what companies are active in this domain in your area in order to raise their interest and support.
* Meeting invitations/announcements should contain a request to forward it to other interested parties.
* Be sure to send out this invitation at least one month before the meeting.
* Network, network, network!

Etc.
