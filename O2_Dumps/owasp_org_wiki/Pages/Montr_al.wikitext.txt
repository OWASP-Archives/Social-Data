==== Training ====

'''[https://www.regonline.com/integratingsecuritymontreal REGISTER NOW!]'''

Integrating security in a webapp project: from the idea to going live
===================================================================
Concept:
A 1-day training covering 3 major topics related to integrating security
in a software development project:
- good practices and tools at design stage (security requirements,
secure design, threat modeling)
- good practices and tools at implementation stage (secure coding
practices and code review)
- good practices and tools at verification stage (security validation)

The entire training will follow a red-line based on a real-life HR web
application project in which we will manage security and privacy
aspects. Students will cover the entire lifecycle of the application,
from analysis to deployment, and integrate good practices and tools
based on OWASP material.

Trainers:
- Antonio Fontes, Switzerland
- Philippe Gamache, Canada
- Sébastien Gioria, France

Course format:
- The training is composed of three modules, each consisting of three
45-minutes blocks (total: 9 blocks)
- Each module includes three blocks: theory, hands-on,
validation/debriefing.

Schedule:
- 8:45-9:30, 9:40-10:25, 10:30-11:15 -> "design" module
- 11:30-12:30 -> lunch
- 12:45-13:30, 13:35-14:20, 14:25-15:10 -> "implementation" module
- 15:10-15:40 -> cookie break
- 15:40-16:25, 16:30-17:15, 17:20-18:05 -> "verification" module
- 18:10 -> closing session (debriefing/conclusions)

We expect students to arrive around 8am and be able to leave around 6:30/7pm

Pre-requisites (required skills and material):
- Bring your own laptop (recommended: dual-core system running
VMWare/Virtualbox)
- Experience in web application development (hands-on will be in JAVA but
do not require in-depth knowledge of the language)
- Understanding of a web application project lifecycle
- Understanding of well-known web application attacks (Top 10 attacks)

== OWASP Montreal - September 15th 2011 - XSS Defense In Depth at Scale!  ==

*'''MAIN PRESENTER:''' Jim Manico, WhiteHat Security and OWASP Podcast 
*'''ABSTRACT:''' This talk will discuss the past methods used for XSS defense that were only partially effective. Learning from these lessons, will will also discuss present day defensive methodologies that are effective, but place an undue burden on the developer. We will then finish with a discussion of future XSS defense mythologies that shift the burden of XSS defense from the developer to various frameworks. These include auto-escaping template technologies, browser-based defenses such as Content Security Policy, and Javascript sandboxes such as the Google CAJA project and JSReg.

Quelles activités peut-on mettre en oeuvre pour maintenir le risque à son niveau le plus bas tout en réduisant les coûts de correction? Quels sont les outils dont dispose le management pour obtenir de l'assurance sécurité dès le lancement d'un projet d'application web?

== Meeting on November 3rd 2009 in Montreal (Pravir Chandra present Software Assurance Maturity Model (OpenSAMM))  ==

*'''MAIN PRESENTER:''' '''Pravir Chandra is Director of Strategic Services at Fortify Software''' and works with clients on software security assurance programs. Pravir is recognized for his expertise in software security, code analysis, and his ability to strategically apply technical knowledge. Prior to Fortify, he was a Principal Consultant affiliated with Cigital and led large software security programs at Fortune 500 companies. Pravir Co-Founded Secure Software, Inc. and was Chief Security Architect prior to its acquisition by Fortify. He recently created and led the Open Software Assurance Maturity Model (OpenSAMM) project with the OWASP Foundation, leads the OWASP CLASP project, and also serves as member of the OWASP Global Projects Committee. Pravir is author of the book Network Security with OpenSSL.

*'''SUBJECT: The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) '''into a software development organization. Covering more than typical SDLC-based models for security, SAMM enables organizations to self-assess their security assurance program and then use recommended roadmaps to improve in a way that's aligned to the specific risks facing the organization. Beyond that, SAMM enables creation of scorecards for an organization's effectiveness at secure software development throughout the typical governance, development, and deployment business functions. Scorecards also enable management within an organization to demonstrate quantitative improvements through iterations of building a security assurance program. This workshop will introduce the SAMM framework and walk through useful activities such as assessing an assurance program, mapping an existing organization to a recommended roadmap, and iteratively building an assurance program. Time allowing, additional case studies will also be discussed. OpenSAMM is an open a free project and has recently been donated to the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Foundation. For more information on OpenSAMM, visit http://www.opensamm.org/
