==Description==

Entity beans that expose a remote interface become part of an application's attack surface. For performance reasons, an application should rarely use remote entity beans, so there is a good chance that a remote entity bean declaration is an error.

==Risk Factors==

* Talk about the [[OWASP Risk Rating Methodology|factors]] that make this vulnerability likely or unlikely to actually happen
* Discuss the technical impact of a successful exploit of this vulnerability
* Consider the likely [business impacts] of a successful attack
