===Project's Purpose ===

OWASP needs to take advantage of every opportunity to affect software development everywhere to achieve our mission "to make application security visible so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about application security risks"

At the [[Summit 2011]] in Portugal, the idea was created to try to influence educational institutions, government bodies, standards groups, and trade organizations. We set out to define a set of minimal requirements for these organizations specifying what we believe to be the most effective ways to support our mission. We call these requirements a “code of conduct” to imply that these are normative standards, they represent a minimum baseline, and that they are not difficult to achieve.

This project develops and maintains OWASP Codes of Conduct, and began with those initially created at the following working sessions at the 2011 OWASP Summit:
* [[:Summit 2011 Working Sessions/Session255|Defining a Minimal AppSec Program for Universities, Governments, and Standards Bodies]]
* [[:Summit 2011 Working Sessions/Session039|Certification]] 
* [[:Summit 2011 Working Sessions/Session012|Outreach to Educational Institutions]]

===The Codes of Conduct===
