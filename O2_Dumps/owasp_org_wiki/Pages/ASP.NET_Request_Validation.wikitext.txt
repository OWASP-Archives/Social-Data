ASP.NET Provides built-in request validation on form submission or postback handling.  Request validation is on by default, and is handled differently by versions of the framework. 

==ASP.NET 1.1 Request Validation Summary==

*Filter  "&#"
*Filter  ‘<’ then alphas or ! or / (tags)
*Filter  "script:"
*Filter  on handlers (onXXX=)
*Filter “expression(“
*Ignore elements named "__VIEWSTATE"


==ASP.NET 2.0 Request Validation Summary==

*Filter  "&#"
*Filter  ‘<’ then alphas or ! or / or ? (tags)
*Ignore elements with names prefixed with double underscore (__)


==ValidateRequest Setting==
===To toggle request validation (it is set to true by default):===

On a single page:

  <%@ Page validateRequest="true|false" %>

For the entire application:

  <configuration>
     <system.web>
          <pages validateRequest="true|false" />
     </system.web>
  </configuration>
