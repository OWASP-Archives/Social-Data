Here is some sample code that can be used to detect RE1. 

<pre>

//the execution of this line will create an exception if an attack is found - ie. something like TRACE is the request method (valid, but not for this app)
boolean isValid = AttackDetectorUtils.verifyValidRequestMethod(myServletRequest, AttackDetectorUtils.POST); 
if (! isValid) {
    notify user ...&nbsp;???
}
</pre>
