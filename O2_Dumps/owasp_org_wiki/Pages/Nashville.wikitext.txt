==== Sponsorship Opportunities  ====

The Nashville OWASP Chapter can offer your company the opportunity to sponsor a Nashville OWASP event.  Below are a listing of the potential opportunities that exist.  If you are interested in taking advantage of any of these opportunities, please contact [mailto:dirk.maxwell@owasp.org Dirk Maxwell], OWASP Nashville Chapter President. 

'''Opportunity #1 - Nashville Security Professionals Happy Hour Sponsorship''' 

The Nashville OWASP Chapter organizes a monthly Nashville Security Professionals Happy Hour. We expect the event to draw around 30 of Austin's finest security professionals for networking and more. Your sponsorship of this event includes appetizers and drinks for the attendees. Feel free to pass out business cards and network just like you would anywhere else. You'll find no better opportunity to get your name in front of 30+ security professionals for around $300. 

'''Opportunity #2 - OWASP Meeting Food and Drink Sponsorship''' 

Our meetings generally involve a meal followed by a presenter.  For your sponsorship of around $10 per attendee, our chapter will provide you with 5 minutes prior to our presentation to introduce yourself and tell us about the products or services that your company offers. You'll also receive mention of being the Food and Drink sponsor in all e-mail communications about the meeting.

'''Opportunity #3 - OWASP Meeting Presenter Sponsorship''' 

Although OWASP is a non-profit organization, we strive to provide our members with the best presenters we possibly can. While the Nashville area has lots of security talent, sometimes it's worthwhile to reach beyond our local membership and invite external presenters. In exchange for covering travel expenses and an honorarium for these presenters, our chapter will provide you with 5 minutes at the start of the meeting to introduce yourself and tell us about the products or services that your company offers. You'll also receive mention of being the presenter sponsor in all e-mail communications about the meeting.
