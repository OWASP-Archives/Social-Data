== Notes 2011-04-04 ==
 
We affirmed that the Creative Commons license will be used for all content on the acadamies portal.

Ricardo pointed out that we need a formal definition of the academy, primarily to enable the best used of time resources. <br> As things are now, given a free hour to contribute to the project, most of that hour is spent trying to find the best direction to proceed.  To that end, we discussed needing an environment for asynch conversation, and using google docs for shared document creation.
* Requirements:  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Academy_Portal_Project/Requirements
* Requirements Discussion: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Talk:OWASP_Academy_Portal_Project/Requirements

We had four participants in the conference call.  Would another time work better for those who did not attend?

The project is at staging.owaspa.org(/moodle)
