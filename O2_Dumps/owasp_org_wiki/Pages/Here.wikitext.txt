SPEAKER AGREEMENT 
 
OWASP CONFERENCE ORGANIZERS MUST CONSENT TO ALL SPEAKER SUBSTITUTIONS.
AS A SPEAKER AT THE OWASP CONFERENCE I ACCEPT THE TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS SPEAKER AGREEMENT. BY REPLYING TO THIS MESSAGE IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, I AM CONSENTING TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT. IF I DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, THEN I WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO SPEAK AT THE OWASP CONFERENCE, IN WHICH EVENT I WILL REPLY TO THIS MESSAGE IN THE NEGATIVE.
 
SPEAKER’S RELEASE 
I accept the offer of the OWASP Foundation to participate as a speaker subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein. 
As a speaker, I will receive one Full Conference pass and no other remuneration. This Full Conference pass includes admission to all keynote sessions and track sessions. Even though I may participate in multiple sessions / panels, I will only receive one pass, and this pass is non-transferable.
 
I understand that the views and opinions expressed at the conference will be mine and not those of OWASP. I agree to indemnify and hold harmless OWASP against any claims, losses, expenses or damages that may be incurred by OWASP as a result of my presentation. In particular, I agree that the use of any materials prepared by me will not expose OWASP to liability for breach of confidence for infringement of copyright or similar liability. Speakers may include their company name when introducing themselves, but may NOT include their logo on any visual and handout materials. Speakers are to avoid any appearance of commercialism in their session and presentations are to be of a technical or solutions emphasis. Further, I understand that the program tracks of the conference are an educational event, not a sales or marketing platform. I agree that my presentation(s) will be an objective review of the topic on which I am presenting, and will not contain any content that is a sales or promotional pitch for any specific product(s) or company(ies). My materials will also be reflective of the current situation of the topic(s) I am addressing. I agree that the information contained in my presentation(s) or related presentation materials (a) will be factual and not misleading, (b) will not violate any obligation of confidentiality that I (or my company or organization) has with any third party, (c) will not violate the intellectual property of any third party and (d) will not defame any third party.
 
In the unavoidable situation that I am unable to fulfill my commitment to speak, OWASP will find an alternate speaker for my session. If I end my employment or affiliation with my company or organization or fail to meet any established deadlines, OWASP reserves the right to replace me as a speaker with another speaker from my company or organization or from another company or organization. 
 
 
COPYRIGHT PERMISSION
If my session includes a presentation, I will use the Conference PowerPoint Template, which will be provided by the OWASP Conferences Chair, as the PowerPoint format for my presentation. I will submit to the OWASP Conferences Chair my presentation(s) in Microsoft PowerPoint format (required) no later than 60 days prior to the conference. Should the presentation change after it has been submitted, I agree to notify the OWASP Conferences Chair that the presentation has changed and I will submit the changed presentation as soon as feasible and at least 24 hours prior to my scheduled session(s). 
 
I understand that OWASP may record (audio and/or video) the conference proceedings, and, that my presentation could be included in any reproduction of the conference materials. I hereby authorize the OWASP Foundation to capture my presentation on audio/visual format or a combination thereof for presentation by OWASP Conference Organizers. Accordingly, I grant the OWASP Foundation the right to: 
Reproduce and distribute the handout materials in any format including paper and electronic formats to any audience. 
Distribute written materials to participants of the OWASP Conferences. 
 
 
I UNDERSTAND THE FOLLOWING:
