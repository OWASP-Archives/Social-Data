| project_description = The iGoat project aims to be a developer learning environment for iOS app developers. It was inspired by the OWASP WebGoat project in particular the developer edition of WebGoat.

Similar to WebGoat (developer), the user is presented with a series of lessons surrounding numerous vulnerabilities associated with iOS apps. The student exploits each vulnerability to validate its existence, and then he implements a remediation in the lesson's source code.

Further, iGoat is designed and implemented modularly, similar conceptually to WebGoat's modular Java EE servlet model. It is intended to provide a foundational framework to build lessons on top of, starting with a core set of lessons provided in the first release.
