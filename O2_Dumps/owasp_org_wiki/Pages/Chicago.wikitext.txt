Please try to include "OWASP" in the subject, and send your name no later than 4PM on January 18th. When you arrive, you will need to sign in with security in the lobby of the building, who will direct you to the cafeteria for refreshments. We will then move to the Auditorium for talks. The meeting is open to everyone and is free to attend!

* 6:00PM - 6:30PM - Refreshments
* 6:30PM - ~9:30PM - Talks!

==Agenda==

'''Speakers''':

* '''Abraham Kang - DOM-based XSS and output encoding'''

An interactive presentation that intends to turn all of the listeners of the presentation into XSS experts and help them understand how to mitigate XSS properly using output encoding.

* '''Luca Carettoni - From CVE-2010-0738 to the recent JBoss worm'''

Being a widely deployed enterprise application server, JBoss has always been a juicy target for attackers. Security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in critical components, such as the infamous JMX-console, can be exploited in order to execute arbitrary code and harm the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the entire system. Our quick journey through JBoss insecurity will start from the analysis of a critical authentication bypass flaw to the recent JBoss worm which affected numerous installations worldwide. This presentation will also cover practical aspects on how to detect misconfigurations and secure your application server. Slides here: [[File:OWASP3011_Luca.pdfâ€Ž]]

'''[http://wittys.com/owasp/OWASP_Chicago_Thomas_Ptacek.pdf]Webapps In Name Only'''
Thomas Ptacek, Matasano Security

Where modern network architecture meets legacy application design, we get "The Port 80 Problem": vendors wrapping every conceivable network protocol in a series of POSTs and calling them "safe". These "Webapps In Name Only" are a nightmare for application security specialists.

In this talk, we'll discuss, with case studies, how tools from protocol reverse engineering can be brought to bear on web application security, covering the following areas:

- Locating and Decompiling Java and .NET Code
- Structure and Interpretation of Binary Protocols in HTTP
- Protocol Debugging Tools
- Web App Crypto Tricks

'''[http://wittys.com/owasp/cscott-Stronger%20Web%20Authentication-v1.0.ppt]Token-less strong authentication for web applications: A Security Review'''
Cory Scott, ABN AMRO

A short presentation on the threat models and attack vectors for token-less schemes used to reduce the risk of password-only authentication, but yet do not implement "true" two-factor technologies for logistical costs or user acceptance reasons. We'll go over how device fingerprinting and IP geo-location work and discuss the pros and cons of the solutions.
