=Project Overview=

<b>The OWASP Mobile Security Project is a centralized resource intended to give developers and security teams the resources they need to build and maintain secure mobile applications.  Through the project, our goal is to classify mobile security risks and provide developmental controls to reduce their impact or likelihood of exploitation. </b>

<b>We have a Google Doc up where anyone that wants to be involved with the project can add their thoughts, suggestions, and take ownership of initiatives. [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bScrvrLJLOHcSbztjBxYoN-jN3kR8bViy9tF8Nx0c08/edit https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bScrvrLJLOHcSbztjBxYoN-jN3kR8bViy9tF8Nx0c08/edit]. There are various tasks that people have started over the past 6 months with varying levels of quality and completeness.</b>
