| project_description = Active XSS testing and input/output encoding detection
x5s is a [http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/ Fiddler]addon which aims to assist penetration testers in finding cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. This is not a point and shoot tool, it requires some understanding of how encoding issues lead to XSS, and it requires manual driving.

It's main goal is to help you identify the hotspots where XSS might occur by:
* Detecting where safe encodings were not applied to emitted user-inputs 
* Detecting where Unicode character transformations might bypass security filters 
* Detecting where non-shortest UTF-8 encodings might bypass security filters
