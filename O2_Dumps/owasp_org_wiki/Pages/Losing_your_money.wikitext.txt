==Description==
Any company as a whole is made up of individuals. If the company experiences a revenue reduction, this translates down to a reduction in benefits for the employees and possibly even to a reduction of the number of its employees.

==Risk Factors==
* The financial report is impacted when an application or network service level agreement is not met 

* Reduction in benefits for the individual 

* Reduction in headcount for the company 

* A company's expenses will exceed its revenues 

* Hackers invading a network or application system 

* PCI compliancy did not occur and the company is fined


==Examples==
===A Company's Expenses Exceed Its Revenues===

The business looks at ways to reduce costs. Employee benefits are re-examined and modified to support reducing company cost thus reducing its yearly expenses. 

===Domino Impact===

A hacker invades a network and finds its way through an application wall.  The customerâ€™s encrypted personal data was opened and used outside in the business market.  The customer files a lawsuit against the company.  The company files bankruptcy.
