<br> '''What Are OWASP Communities?'''

[http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Builders Builders], [http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Breakers Breakers] and Defenders; the idea of OWASP Communities is to bring together experts in the area that they are best at with the common goal of advancing the state of application security.  This approach allows similar groups of professionals and experts to tackle security problems with the involvement of the most relevant stakeholders.  The intent is to drive high quality output that is immediately usable by the target audience.  More information about this vision can be found [http://michael-coates.blogspot.com/2011/02/vision-for-owasp.html here]

==== Roadmap  ====
* Determine the current market need. This requires involvement from people in enterprise that are tacking these problems. No guessing about what we think people need. 
* Evaluate current OWASP projects to understand match with market need and quality of projects 
* Identify 3-4 projects that will be focused on for growth and promotion 
* Archive other projects (within defender domain) that are abandoned or not inline with market need 
* Cross training - We should all be able to help out to advance our 3-4 core projects
* Significantly advance quality of selected projects
* Community outreach for adoption
* High quality marketing efforts
* Conference presentations across multiple projects
