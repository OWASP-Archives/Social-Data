This will be the hottest panel of the year! Join us as Chenxi overviews manual services and automated tools, and blackbox, whitebox, and WAF. Ask Robert, YM, Fyodor, KK and Dhruv questions regarding pentesting and security services—they’re experts of the discipline. Thinking whether to scan or to WAF? Ask Alex, he recently published a WAF best practices whitepaper for OWASP!
