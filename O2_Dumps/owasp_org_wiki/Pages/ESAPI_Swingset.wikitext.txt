==How Can I help with Swingset==
The ESAPI Swingset is still in an early beta stage.  Many pages within Swingset are still incomplete, and we could certainly use some help getting them finished.  If you are interested in helping, please see [[Building_ESAPI_Swingset|this page]] for instructions on how to download and build the latest SVN version of the Swingset.

If you have any ideas for how the ESAPI Swingset could be better, or if you would like to submit new code, please contact any of the project leaders.
