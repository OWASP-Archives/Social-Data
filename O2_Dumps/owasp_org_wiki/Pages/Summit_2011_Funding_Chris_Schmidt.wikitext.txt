| Personal_Request_Text = <!-- PUT THE REQUEST TEXT BELOW-->
Since getting involved with OWASP and the Enterprise Security API, I have had the opportunity to use my knowledge to help countless individuals and organizations make their web applications just a bit more secure for their users. I have had the opportunity to help make the internet just a little safer for my dad to order Christmas presents for my kids online. In the grand scheme of things, this is invaluable to a world that depends more and more on the internet with each passing year. 

The OWASP Summit is an opportunity for some of the most forward minds in the application security space to get together and solve the problems of tomorrow's internet, an opportunity to get ahead of the curve in a world where we are constantly playing catch-up. 

Whether you are a developer who has learned from OWASP materials, a tester who uses the free OWASP tools, or an end-user who just wants to be secure on the web, please consider donating whatever you can to help make the OWASP Summit a success. 

I personally thank you for taking the time to read my message and your consideration.
