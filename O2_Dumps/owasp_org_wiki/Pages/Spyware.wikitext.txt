==Description==
Spyware is a program that captures statistical information from a user's computer and sends it over internet without user acceptance. This information is usually obtained from cookies and the web browserâ€™s history. Spyware can also install other software, display advertisements, or redirect the web browser activity.
Spyware differs from a virus, worm, and adware in various ways. Spyware does not self-replicate and distribute itself like viruses and worms, and does not necessarily display advertisements like adware. The common characteristics between spyware and viruses, worms, and adware are:
# exploitation of the infected computer for commercial purposes
# the display, in some cases, of advertisements

==Risk Factors==

High

Some Spyware is very dificult to remove because it can hide  in Browser Cookies and Offline HTML Content in Temporary files.
