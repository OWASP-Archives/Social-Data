'''This page track all the update to the Testing Guide v3 during the Reviewing phase.'''<br>

In particular the focus is:<br>
- Review the content of each article<br>
- Review the english sintax<br>
- no "attacker", better "tester"<br>
- no "we describe", but "it is described"<br>

** Section 4.11 [[Testing for AJAX Vulnerabilities (OWASP-AJ-001)|Testing for AJAX Vulnerabilities]]
*** There are mentioning of "attackers" but I think they are fine.
*** The subsection on Memory leaks is not complete.
** Section 4.11 [[Testing for AJAX  (OWASP-AJ-002)|Testing for AJAX]]
*** The subsection "Intercepting and Debugging JS code with Browsers" is very difficult to understand. I tried to fix it, but I'm afraid what I have might not reflect what the original author wanted to express.

** Section 4.10
*** Subsection [[Testing for WS Replay   (OWASP-WS-007)|Testing for WS Replay]] Gray box testing and examples gives incomplete sample code. I believe the call to GetSessionIDMac() missed four parameters. In this same part, using SSL helps in preventing replay attack but it doesnt prevent replay attack by itself. In this same subection, the images show identifiable real Internet address in Hungary, should them be masked off?

<br> 
* I was concerned about the structure and flow of this section.  It did not read cleanly for me and appeared more "wordy" then the other sections. The format also did not appear to be consistent with the other sections resulting in a disjointed feeling when reading it.<br>

4.3.8 Testing for HTTP Methods and XST<br> 
* Grammer change in the section "Arbitrary HTTP Methods". Changed "and / or" to "and/or"
* Grammer change in section "Test XST Potential"  andded a space between bullet number 1 and 2 and the text.

4.4 Business Logic Testing <br> 
<br> 
* The section read out a little longer then the other sections.  All the content was interesting and relevant.  I would suggest taking Example 2 and breaking it out into another example (Example 2.1 or 3?)in order to break up the flow. I found my self losing my train of thought the further I read into it<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
4.5 Authentication Testing<br> 
*What is "provenance"? It might be better to use adifferent, more common word with the same meaning.  An average user might get confused if they do not know what it means. <br>
4.5.1 Credentials transport over an encrypted channel <br>
*  I made several grammar related changes (commas and is vs are)and one content change.  Please crosscheck to insure the context is the same and check for additional grammar issues.<br>

4.8.3 Testing for DOM based Cross Site Scripting <br>
* Section feels incomplete.  The content appears to end abruptly.  The author mentions source code review for Black and Greybox testing.  While this is the likely test process It would be nice to include a tool-based test if one exists for those of us who are not coders and have only rudimentary experience with code.  <br>

Questions: (Mat will answer it)<br>
4.10.1 WS Information Gathering
