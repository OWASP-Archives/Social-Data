==== Topic ====

'''Application Security Verification Standard, and&nbsp;Q&amp;A session on Global Chapter HandBook and Global Chapters Committee''' 

This talk will take you through the history of the ASVS, what the ASVS attempts to cover, and what it deliberately doesn't cover. Lastly, we will look at the future of the ASVS and where you can help with the ASVS effort. 

Andrew will hold a 'Q&amp;A' session on global chapters handbook and global chapters committee, in which he will take you through the current Global Chapter Handbook, some of the changes we are considering to make things better / clearer, and then take questions from the floor about the global chapters committee and what we can do for local membership drives and helping chapters succeed.
