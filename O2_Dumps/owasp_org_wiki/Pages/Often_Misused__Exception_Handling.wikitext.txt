==Description==
The _alloca() function can throw a stack overflow exception, potentially causing the program to crash. The _alloca() function allocates memory on the stack. If an allocation request is too large for the available stack space, _alloca() throws an exception. If the exception is not caught, the program will crash, potentially enabling a denial of service attack.

_alloca() has been deprecated as of Microsoft Visual Studio 2005Â®. It has been replaced with the more secure _alloca_s().
