This is a project of the [[Germany | OWASP German Chapter]].

==Abstract==
Technical review of the module web application
("Baustein Webanwendungen") of the IT-baseline protection catalog ("IT
Grundschutz Katalog") of the German Federal Office for Information
Security ("BSI") from the OWASP's point of view.

==Introduction==
The German "Federal Office for Information Security" (BSI), which is
comparable to departments focused on security in organizations like NIST
or CCTA, offers the IT Baseline Protection ("IT-Grundschutz") for public
usage, which is based on ISO/IEC 27001. The IT Baseline Protection
include a catalog of approx. 80 "Bausteine" (building blocks). Those
blocks are dealing with one particular subject of IT security. They are
usually written in the German language and later translated to English.
They become the de facto standard for IT security and related
certifications in Germany after they are finally released.

In January 2012 the draft of the block "Webanwendungen" (web
applications) was released with a request for comments. Since this is
the core expertise of OWASP we invited a delegate of the BSI to attend
the last chapter meeting of the German Chapter which took place in
Frankfurt / Main on the 3rd of February. The meeting's outcome was the
strong wish to perform a review of that very web application block as an
OWASP project. This project will help to expand the visibility of OWASP
in the German IT security landscape broadly.


==Roadmap==
* Building a coordinating team
* <b>Defining the review rules</b> [[Talk:OWASP_Review_BSI_IT-Grundschutz_Baustein_Webanwendungen| see "Discussion"]]   
* Reading the BSI documents
* Collecting comments from the community familiar with the BSI documents
* Creating a common understanding
* Writing a review with OWASP glasses 
* Review of OWASP's review itself
* Releasing the result(s)

==Deadline==
