KEY PARTICIPANTS IN THE [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management RISK MANAGEMENT] PROCESS


The following sections describe the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Roles_and_Responsibilities roles and responsibilities] of key participants involved in an organization's [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] process.<ref>Organizations may define other roles (e.g., [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Facilities facilities] manager, human resources manager, systems administrator) to support the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] process.</ref> Recognizing that organizations have widely varying missions and organizational structures, there may be differences in [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Naming_Conventions naming conventions] for [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management]-related roles and how specific responsibilities are allocated among organizational personnel (e.g., multiple individuals filling a single role or one individual filling multiple roles).<ref>Caution should be exercised when one individual fills multiples roles in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] process to ensure that the individual retains an appropriate level of independence and remains free from conflicts of interest.</ref> However, the basic functions remain the same. The application of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management Risk Management] Framework described in this publication is flexible, allowing organizations to effectively accomplish the intent of the specific tasks within their respective organizational structures to best manage [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System-related_Security_Risks information system-related security risks]. Many [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] roles defined in this publication have counterpart roles defined in the routine [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Development_Life_Cycle system development life cycle] processes carried out by organizations. Whenever possible, organizations align the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] roles with similar (or complementary) roles defined for the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Development_Life_Cycle system development life cycle].<ref>For example, the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Development_Life_Cycle system development life cycle] role of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Developer system developer] or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Program_Manager program manager] can be aligned with [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner]; mission owner/manager can be aligned with [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official]; and system/software engineers are complementary roles to information system security engineers.</ref> [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management Risk Management] Framework tasks are executed concurrently with ongoing [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Development_Life_Cycle system development life cycle] processes, thereby effectively integrating the process of managing [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System-related_Security_Risks information system-related security risks] with ongoing [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Life_Cycle life cycle] processes.


== D.1  HEAD OF AGENCY (CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER) ==

The head of agency (or chief executive officer) is the highest-level [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Senior_Official senior official] or executive within an organization with the overall responsibility to provide information [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Protections security protections] commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm (i.e., impact) to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation resulting from [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Unauthorized_Access unauthorized access], use, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Disclosure disclosure], [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Disruption disruption], modification, or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Destruction destruction] of: (i) information collected or maintained by or on behalf of the agency; and (ii) information systems used or operated by an agency or by a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Contractor contractor] of an agency or other organization on behalf of an agency. Agency heads are also responsible for ensuring that: (i) information security management processes are integrated with strategic and operational planning processes; (ii) senior officials within the organization provide information security for the information and information systems that support the operations and assets under their control; and (iii) the organization has trained personnel sufficient to assist in complying with the information [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Requirements security requirements] in related legislation, policies, directives, instructions, standards, and guidelines. Through the development and implementation of strong policies, the head of agency establishes the organizational commitment to information security and the actions required to effectively manage risk and protect the core missions and business functions being carried out by the organization. Senior leadership commitment to information security establishes a level of due diligence within the organization that promotes a climate for mission and business success.


== D.2  [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) RISK EXECUTIVE (FUNCTION)] ==

The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)] is an individual or group within an organization that helps to ensure that: (i) risk-related considerations for individual information systems, to include authorization decisions for those systems, are viewed from an organization-wide perspective with regard to the overall strategic goals and objectives of the organization in carrying out its core missions and business functions; and (ii) managing risk from individual information systems is consistent across the organization, reflects organizational [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Tolerance risk tolerance], and is considered along with other types of risks in order to ensure mission/business success. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)] coordinates with the senior leadership of an organization to:

*   Provide a comprehensive, organization-wide, holistic approach for addressing riskâ€”an approach that provides a greater understanding of the integrated operations of the organization;
*   Develop a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] strategy for the organization providing a strategic view of information security-related risks with regard to the organization as a whole;<ref>Authorizing officials may have narrow or localized perspectives in rendering authorization decisions, in some cases without fully understanding or explicitly accepting the risks being incurred from such decisions. The responsibility of authorizing officials described in [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:FIPS_200 FIPS 200], was extended in [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:NIST_Special_Publication_800-53 NIST Special Publication 800-53] to include risks to other organizations and the Nation.</ref>
*   Facilitate the sharing of risk-related information among authorizing officials and other senior leaders within the organization;
*   Provide oversight for all [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management]-related activities across the organization (e.g., security categorizations) to help ensure consistent and effective risk [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Acceptance acceptance] decisions;
*   Ensure that authorization decisions consider all factors necessary for mission and business success;
*   Provide an organization-wide forum to consider all sources of risk (including [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Aggregated_Risk aggregated risk] from individual information systems) to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation;
*   Promote cooperation and collaboration among authorizing officials to include authorization actions requiring shared responsibility;
*   Identify the overall organizational risk posture based on the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Aggregated_Risk aggregated risk] from each of the information systems for which the organization is responsible; and
*   Ensure that the shared responsibility for supporting organizational mission/business functions using external providers of information and services receives the needed visibility and is elevated to the appropriate decision-making authorities.

The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)] presumes neither a specific organizational structure nor formal responsibility assigned to any one individual or group within the organization. The head of the agency/organization may choose to retain the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)] or to delegate the function to another official or group (e.g., an executive leadership [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:Council council]). The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)] has inherent U.S. Government authority and is assigned to government personnel only.


== D.3  [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Chief_Information_Officer CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER] ==

The chief information officer<ref>When an organization has not designated a formal [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Chief_Information_Officer chief information officer] position, FISMA requires the associated responsibilities to be handled by a comparable organizational official.</ref> is an organizational official responsible for: (i) designating a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Senior_Information_Security_Officer senior information security officer]; (ii) developing and maintaining information security policies, procedures, and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Control_Techniques control techniques] to address all applicable requirements; (iii) overseeing personnel with significant responsibilities for information security and ensuring that the personnel are adequately trained; ([http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:IV iv]) assisting senior organizational officials concerning their security responsibilities; and (v) in [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Coordination coordination] with other senior officials, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Reporting reporting] annually to the head of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Federal_Agency federal agency] on the overall effectiveness of the organization's information [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Program security program], including progress of remedial actions. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Chief_Information_Officer chief information officer], with the support of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)] and the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Senior_Information_Security_Officer senior information security officer], works closely with authorizing officials and their designated representatives to help ensure that:

*   An organization-wide information [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Program security program] is effectively implemented resulting in [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Adequate_Security adequate security] for all organizational information systems and environments of operation for those systems;
*   Information security considerations are integrated into programming/planning/budgeting cycles, enterprise [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Architectures architectures], and acquisition/system development life cycles;
*   Information systems are covered by approved security plans and are authorized to operate;
*   Information security-related activities required across the organization are accomplished in an efficient, cost-effective, and timely manner; and

The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Chief_Information_Officer chief information officer] and authorizing officials also determine, based on organizational priorities, the appropriate allocation of resources dedicated to the protection of the information systems supporting the organization's missions and business functions. For selected information systems, the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Chief_Information_Officer chief information officer] may be designated as an [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] or a co-authorizing official with other senior organizational officials. The role of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Chief_Information_Officer chief information officer] has inherent U.S. Government authority and is assigned to government personnel only.


== D.4  INFORMATION OWNER/STEWARD ==

The information owner/steward is an organizational official with statutory, management, or operational authority for specified information and the responsibility for establishing the policies and procedures governing its generation, collection, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Processing processing], [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Dissemination dissemination], and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Disposal disposal].<ref>Federal information is an asset of the Nation, not of a particular [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Federal_Agency federal agency] or its subordinate organizations. In that spirit, many federal agencies are developing policies, procedures, processes, and training needed to end the practice of information ownership and implement the practice of information stewardship. Information stewardship is the careful and responsible management of federal information belonging to the Nation as a whole, regardless of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Entity entity] or source that may have originated, created, or compiled the information. Information stewards provide maximum access to federal information to elements of the federal government and its customers, balanced by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Obligation obligation] to protect the information in accordance with the provisions of FISMA and any associated security-related federal policies, directives, regulations, standards, and guidance.</ref> In information-sharing environments, the information owner/steward is responsible for establishing the rules for appropriate use and protection of the subject information (e.g., [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Rules_of_Behavior rules of behavior]) and retains that responsibility even when the information is shared with or provided to other organizations. The owner/steward of the information processed, stored, or transmitted by an information system may or may not be the same as the system owner. A single information system may contain information from multiple information owners/stewards. Information owners/stewards provide input to information system owners regarding the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Requirements security requirements] and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] for the systems where the information is processed, stored, or transmitted.


== D.5  [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Senior_Information_Security_Officer SENIOR INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER] ==

The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Senior_Information_Security_Officer senior information security officer] is an organizational official responsible for: (i) carrying out the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Chief_Information_Officer chief information officer] security responsibilities under FISMA; and (ii) serving as the primary liaison for the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Chief_Information_Officer chief information officer] to the organization's authorizing officials, information system owners, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control common control] providers, and information system security officers. The senior information security officer: (i) possesses professional qualifications, including training and experience, required to administer the information [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Program security program] functions; (ii) maintains information security duties as a primary responsibility; and (iii) heads an office with the mission and resources to assist the organization in achieving more secure information and information systems in accordance with the requirements in FISMA. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Senior_Information_Security_Officer senior information security officer] (or supporting staff members) may also serve as [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] designated representatives or security control assessors. The role of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Senior_Information_Security_Officer senior information security officer] has inherent U.S. Government authority and is assigned to government personnel only.


== D.6  [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official AUTHORIZING OFFICIAL] ==

The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] is a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Senior_Official senior official] or executive with the authority to formally assume responsibility for operating an information system at an [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Acceptable_Level_of_Risk acceptable level of risk] to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Authorizing officials typically have budgetary oversight for an information system or are responsible for the mission and/or business operations supported by the system. Through the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] process, authorizing officials are accountable for the security risks associated with information system operations. Accordingly, authorizing officials are in management positions with a level of authority commensurate with understanding and accepting such [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System-related_Security_Risks information system-related security risks]. Authorizing officials also approve security plans, memorandums of agreement or understanding, and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Plans_of_Action_and_Milestones plans of action and milestones] and determine whether significant changes in the information systems or environments of operation require reauthorization. Authorizing officials can deny [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorization_to_Operate authorization to operate] an information system or if the system is operational, halt operations, if unacceptable risks exist. Authorizing officials coordinate their activities with the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)], [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Chief_Information_Officer chief information officer], [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Senior_Information_Security_Officer senior information security officer], [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control common control] providers, information system owners, information system security officers, security control assessors, and other interested parties during the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] process. With the increasing complexity of missions/business processes, partnership arrangements, and the use of external/shared services, it is possible that a particular information system may involve multiple authorizing officials. If so, agreements are established among the authorizing officials and documented in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan]. Authorizing officials are responsible for ensuring that all activities and functions associated with [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] that are delegated to [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] designated representatives are carried out. The role of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] has inherent U.S. Government authority and is assigned to government personnel only.


== D.7  [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official_Designated_Representative AUTHORIZING OFFICIAL DESIGNATED REPRESENTATIVE] ==

The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official_Designated_Representative authorizing official designated representative] is an organizational official that acts on behalf of an [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] to coordinate and conduct the required day-to-day activities associated with the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] process. [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official Authorizing official] designated representatives can be empowered by authorizing officials to make certain decisions with regard to the planning and resourcing of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] process, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Acceptance acceptance] of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan], approval and monitoring the implementation of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Plans_of_Action_and_Milestones plans of action and milestones], and the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] and/or determination of risk. The designated representative may also be called upon to prepare the final authorization package, obtain the authorizing official's signature on the authorization decision document, and transmit the authorization package to appropriate organizational officials. The only [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Activity activity] that cannot be delegated to the designated representative by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] is the authorization decision and signing of the associated authorization decision document (i.e., the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Acceptance acceptance] of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation).


== D.8  [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider COMMON CONTROL PROVIDER] ==

The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider] is an individual, group, or organization responsible for the development, implementation, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment], and monitoring of common controls (i.e., [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] inherited by information systems).<ref>Organizations can have multiple [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control common control] providers depending on how information security responsibilities are allocated organization-wide. [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control Common control] providers may also be information system owners when the common controls are resident within an information system. Common controls are described in Section 2.4.</ref> [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control Common control] providers are responsible for: (i) documenting the organization-identified common controls in a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan] (or equivalent document prescribed by the organization); (ii) ensuring that required assessments of common controls are carried out by qualified assessors with an appropriate level of independence defined by the organization; (iii) documenting [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment_Findings assessment findings] in a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:security_assessment_report security assessment report]; and ([http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:IV iv]) producing a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Plan_of_Action_and_Milestones plan of action and milestones] for all controls having weaknesses or deficiencies. Security plans, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Assessment security assessment] reports, and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Plans_of_Action_and_Milestones plans of action and milestones] for common controls (or a summary of such information) is made available to information system owners inheriting those controls after the information is reviewed and approved by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Senior_Official senior official] or executive with oversight responsibility for those controls.

The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Security_Engineer information system security engineer] is an individual, group, or organization responsible for conducting [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Security_Engineering information system security engineering] activities. [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Security_Engineering Information system security engineering] is a process that captures and refines information [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Requirements security requirements] and ensures that the requirements are effectively integrated into information technology component products and information systems through purposeful security architecting, design, development, and configuration. Information system security engineers are an integral part of the development team (e.g., integrated project team) designing and developing organizational information systems or upgrading [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Legacy_Systems legacy systems]. Information system security engineers employ best practices when implementing [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] within an information system including software engineering methodologies, system/security engineering principles, and secure coding techniques. System security engineers coordinate their security-related activities with information security architects, senior information security officers, information system owners, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control common control] providers, and information system security officers.


== D.13  [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Control_Assessor SECURITY CONTROL ASSESSOR] ==

The security control assessor<ref>Security control assessors may be called certification agents in some organizations. At the discretion of the organization, security control assessors may be given additional duties/responsibilities for the post [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Processing processing] and analysis of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Control_Assessment security control assessment] findings and results. This may include, for example, making specific determinations for or recommendations to authorizing officials (known in some [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Communities_of_Interest communities of interest] as certification recommendations or certification determinations).</ref> is an individual, group, or organization responsible for conducting a comprehensive [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] of the management, operational, and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Technical_Security technical security] controls employed within or inherited by an information system to determine the overall effectiveness of the controls (i.e., the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Requirements security requirements] for the system). Security control assessors also provide an [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] of the severity of weaknesses or deficiencies discovered in the information system and its environment of operation and recommend corrective actions to address identified vulnerabilities. In addition to the above responsibilities, security control assessors prepare the final [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:security_assessment_report security assessment report] containing the results and findings from the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment]. Prior to initiating the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Control_Assessment security control assessment], an [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessor assessor] conducts an [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan] to help ensure that the plan provides a set of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] for the information system that meet the stated [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Requirements security requirements].

The required level of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessor assessor] independence is determined by the specific conditions of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Control_Assessment security control assessment]. For example, when the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] is conducted in support of an authorization decision, the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] makes an explicit determination of the degree of independence required in accordance with federal policies, directives, standards, and guidelines. [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessor Assessor] independence is an important factor in: (i) preserving the impartial and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Unbiased unbiased] nature of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] process; (ii) determining the credibility of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Assessment security assessment] results; and (iii) ensuring that the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] receives the most objective information possible in order to make an informed, risk-based, authorization decision. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner] and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider] rely on the security expertise and the technical judgment of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessor assessor] to: (i) assess the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] employed within and inherited by the information system using [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] procedures specified in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:security_assessment_plan security assessment plan]; and (ii) provide specific recommendations on how to correct weaknesses or deficiencies in the controls and address identified vulnerabilities.
