'''The Rugged Software Manifesto'''


I am rugged... and more importantly, my code is rugged. 

I recognize that software has become a foundation of our modern world.

I recognize the awesome responsibility that comes with this foundational role.

I recognize that my code will be used in ways I cannot anticipate, in ways it was not designed, and for longer than it was ever intended.

I recognize that my code will be attacked by talented and persistent adversaries who threaten our physical, economic, and national security.


''I recognize these things - and I choose to be rugged.''


I am rugged because I refuse to be a source of vulnerability or weakness.

I am rugged because I assure my code will support its mission. 

I am rugged because my code can face these challenges and persist in spite of them.

I am rugged, not because it is easy, but because it is necessary... and I am up for the challenge.
