==Description==

Strings should be compared with the equals() method, not == or !=.

This program uses == or != to compare two strings for equality, which compares two objects for equality, not their values. Chances are good that the two references will never be equal.

==Risk Factors==
TBD

==Examples ==

The following branch will never be taken.

<pre>
	  if (args[0] == STRING_CONSTANT) {
		  logger.info("miracle");
	  }

</pre>
