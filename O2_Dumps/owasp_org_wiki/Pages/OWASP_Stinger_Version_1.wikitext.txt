==Overview==

The J2EE platform does not include any validation features. This leaves many organizations to craft their own validation mechanisms, often incomplete, flawed, and inefficient. The basic idea is to define validation rules for the headers, cookies, and parameters of an HTTP request. These rules are specified in simple XML files using the 'Security Validation Definition Language.'
