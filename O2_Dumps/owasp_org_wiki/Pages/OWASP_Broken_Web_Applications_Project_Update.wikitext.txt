== The presentation  ==

[[Image:Owasp_logo_normal.jpg|right]]At AppSecDC in 2009, the OWASP Broken Web Applications (OWASP BWA) Project was announced and the first version of the project virtual machine was released.  The virtual machine provides a standard set of web applications with various types of security vulnerabilities and is well suited for use as a learning environment and as a standard target for testing tools and techniques.  This talk will provide an update on the current state of the project and describe the vision for the projectâ€™s future.
