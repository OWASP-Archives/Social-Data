Samy Kamkar is best known for the Samy worm, the first XSS worm, infecting over one million users on MySpace in less than 24 hours. A co-founder of Fonality, Inc., an IP PBX company, Samy previously led the development of top-level domain name server software and systems for Global Domains International (.ws).

In the past 10 years, Samy has focused on evolutionary and genetic algorithmic software development, Voice over IP software development, automated security and vulnerability research in network security, reverse engineering, and network gaming.

''' How Samy met your girlfriend ''' 

How I Met Your Girlfriend: The discovery and execution of entirely new classes of Web attacks in order to meet your girlfriend.

This includes entertaining and newly discovered attacks including PHP session prediction and random numbers (accurately guessing PHP session cookies), browser protocol confusion (turning a browser into an SMTP server), firewall and NAT penetration via Javascript (turning your router against you), extracting extremely accurate geolocation information from a Web browser (not using IP geolocation), and more.

''' Bios '''

Christian Heinrich is the Project Leader of the OWASP "Google Hacking" Project i.e. "Download Indexed Cache" and has contributed to the "Spiders/Robots/Crawlers" and "Search Engine Reconnaissance" sections of the OWASP Testing Guide v3 and more recently to the development of the OWASP Top Ten and Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) OWASP Projects. He has presented at OWASP Conferences in USA, Australia and Europe and OWASP Chapters in London, UK and Sydney and Melbourne, Australia.<br> 

<u>Google Hacking:</u> 

Google Hacks is a compilation of carefully crafted Google searches that expose novel functionality from Google's search and map services. For example, you can use it to view a timeline of your search results, view a map, search for music, search for books, and perform many other specific kinds of searches. You can also use this program to use google as a proxy.<br> 

<u>Skipfish:</u> 

A fully automated, active web application security reconnaissance tool. Key features: High speed: pure C code, highly optimized HTTP handling, minimal CPU footprint - easily achieving 2000 requests per second with responsive targets. Ease of use: heuristics to support a variety of quirky web frameworks and mixed-technology sites, with automatic learning capabilities, on-the-fly wordlist creation, and form autocompletion. Cutting-edge security logic: high quality, low false positive, differential security checks, capable of spotting a range of subtle flaws, including blind injection vectors.<br>

''' PROGRAM  '''
<b>18:00 - 18:30 Check-In (catering included)</b><br>
<b>18:30 - 18:45 Introduction (OWASP organization, projects, sponsor)</b><br>
<b>18.45 - 19.45 Web Application Firewalls in dynamic environments</b>(by Alexander Meisel)<br>
Alexander Meisel is the CTO of 'art of defence' (AOD), a German based software vendor. The company specializes in high performance deployments of Web Application Firewalls in very dynamic environments all over the world.

Abstract:
The current trend towards cloud computing forces everybody to deploy services in a virtual environment. In current dedicated environments WAFs or Web Application Firewalls are mostly deployed as a hardware (black) box which is easy at first but limits them to only low performance web cluster architectures. Moving those systems virtualized into a cloud environment makes almost no sense because of the resource limitations.
The is solution is a redesign which enables WAFs to be part of a true message based cloud system. This talk explains how truly virtualized and distributed web applications are architected, work and scale in high performance environments. <br>
<b>19.45 – 20.00 Break</b><br>
<b>20.00 - 21:00 Bypassing Web Application Firewalls </b>(by Sandro Gauci)<br>
Sandro Gauci is the owner and Founder of EnableSecurity (www.enablesecurity.com) where he performs R&D and security consultancy for mid-sized companies. Sandro has over 9 years experience in the security industry and is focused on analysis of security challenges and providing solutions to such threats. Hispassion is vulnerability research and has previously worked together with various endors such as Microsoft and Sun to fix security holes. Sandro is the author of the free VoIP security scanning suite SIPVicious (sipvicious.org) and VOIPPACK for CANVAS.

Abstract:
WAFs or Web Application Firewalls are being deployed to fix security issues in your web applications. The question is, are they?
In this presentation we take a look at some of the issues related to making use of this solution and how it may affect the overall security posture of your web application. Finally we will describe tools to automate detection of WAFs, and also tools to help identify ways to bypass WAFs. This presentation will include updates to the open source WAF security testing tools - WAFFIT. <br>

<b>18:00 - 18:30 Check-In (catering included)</b><br>
<b>18:30 - 18:45 Introduction (OWASP organization, projects, sponsor)</b><br>
<b>18.45 - 19.45 SQL Injection - How far does the rabbit hole go?</b> (By Justin Clarke)<br>
<b>Justin Clarke</b>  is a co-founder and Director at Gotham Digital Science, based in the United Kingdom. He has over twelve years of experience in assessing the security of networks, web applications, and wireless networks for large financial, retail, technology and government clients in the United States, the United Kingdom and New Zealand.
Justin is the the technical editor and lead author of “SQL Injection Attacks and Defense” (Syngress 2009), co-author of "Network Security Tools: Writing, Hacking, and Modifying Security Tools" (O’Reilly 2005), a contributing author to "Network Security Assessment: Know Your Network, 2nd Edition" (O’Reilly 2007), as well as a speaker at a number of conferences and events on security topics, including Black Hat USA, EuSecWest, OSCON, ISACA, RSA, SANS, OWASP, and the British Computer Society. He is the author of the open source SQLBrute blind SQL injection testing tool, and is the Chapter Leader for the London chapter of OWASP.
SQl Injection - How far does the rabbit hole go? SQL Injection has been around for over 10 years, and yet it is still to this day not truly understood by many security professionals and developers. With the recent mass attacks against sites across the world it has again come to the fore of vulnerabilities under the spotlight, however many consider it to only be a data access issue, or parameterized queries to be a panacea.<br>
This talk starts from what was demonstrated last year at Black Hat in Las Vegas, where a self propagating SQL Injection worm was demonstrated live on stage. Explore some of the deeper, darker areas of SQL Injection, hybrid attacks, and exploiting obscure database functionality<br>

<b>19.45 – 20.00 Break</b><br>
<b>20. 00 – 20.30 VAC Insecure Direct Object Reference</b> (By Marinus Kuivenhoven)<br>
<b>Marinus Kuivenhoven</b> is a Senior Technology Specialist with Sogeti Nederland B.V. specializing in service oriented architectures and secure application development. His experience include developing and administrating Oracle-based systems. At Sogeti Nederland B.V. he is also an active member of the PaSS -Software(Proactive Security Strategy) taskforce focusing on secure application development. Marinus also developed and teaches several application security courses both within and outside Sogeti. In the past years he has written for magazine such as Computable and We Love IT. And he has spoken on a number of conferences and events like OWASP, Recent OO Trends, Open Source Developer Conference and Engineering World.
<b>Vulnerability:</b> Insecure Direct Object Reference is when a web application exposes an internal implementation object to the user. Some examples of internal implementation objects are database records, URLs, or files.<br>
<b>Attack:</b> An attacker can modify the internal implementation object in an attempt to abuse the access controls on this object. When the attacker does this they may have the ability to access functionality that the developer didn’t intend to expose access to.<br>
<b>Countermeasure:</b> Reference should be validated for authorization and accessed through reference maps. How this should be done will be shown.<br>

<b>20.30 – 21.15 Overlooked Resources and Practices</b> (By Justin Clarke)<br>
In his second presentation, Justin Clarke discussed OWASP resources and best practices by highlighting some OWASP projects and underused security practices. He shared his experiences in his daily work as well as the known pitfalls.<br>
([[Media:20100311_Overlooked_Resources_and _Practices-Justin_Clarke.pdf|the slides in pdf format]])<br>
