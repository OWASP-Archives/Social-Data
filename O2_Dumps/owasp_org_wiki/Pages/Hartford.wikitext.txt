== Sponsors ==

We would like to thank [http://www.hp.com/ HP], [http://www.oracle.com/ Oracle], [http://www.ca.com/ CA], and [http://www.microsoft.com/ Microsoft] for their generous sponsorship and helping make application security visible...

If you would like to sponsor either the food and/or door prizes for an upcoming meeting, please email [mailto:owasp@jamesmcgovern.com James McGovern] with your proposal. Independent of any financial considerations, sponsorship priority is driven by those who drive participation in OWASP to their employees and customers.

<br><br>

== Call for Sponsors/Speakers ==

This is a call for speakers/papers. If we haven't approached you, but you believe you have a significant discovery or new research that the security community would value, or enjoy hearing about, we invite you to submit your presentation topic for serious consideration. Preference will be given to speakers who can present new and innovative technical content to a broad audience. Of course, all presentations are expected to challenge the brightest and quickest of attendees - we wouldn't have it any other way. 

OWASP is not a vendor fair. Consequently, there will be very little tolerance for commercial content within presentations. Attendees will be encouraged to quell any shameless marketing that is not immediately backed up with rationale for its inclusion. 

Some topics of interest for upcoming meetings include (but are not limited to):
* Cloud Security with a focus on PAAS
* Breaking CAPTCHA
* Threat modeling
* Mobile Security
* Entitlements Management
* Advanced Persistent Threats
* Misuse/abuse cases for business analysts

Speaking at a upcoming meeting on a OWASP project or vendor agnostic research topic. [http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=owaspnyc2010 SUBMIT HERE]
