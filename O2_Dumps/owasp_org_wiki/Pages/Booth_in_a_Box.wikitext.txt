'''Basic concept'''

“Booth in a Box” a standard shipping box that we send to “free” booths OWASP gets to support events.  OWASP leaders who get the booth will use it for their event and then ship it back to the regional administrator.  The regional administrator verifies the contents/condition of the items in the box and then ships it to go to the next regional/local area.  The booth will get replenished (via GCC budget line item) and as part of the checkin/checkout process will be reconciled.  To get the project started there will be one booth booth in North America, Latin America, Europe and ASIAPAC.
