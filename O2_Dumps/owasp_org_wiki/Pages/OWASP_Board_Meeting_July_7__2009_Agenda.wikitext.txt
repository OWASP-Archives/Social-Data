[http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:Owasp_review.doc Kate's Review]

'''IT Issues:'''

1.  What to do about wiki/forums/mailing lists? (need answers asap)
* Liferay (java based cms) -- possible hosted env.
* Drupal -- can handle member/conference registrations
* Ultimate BBS with mailing list integration
* What are we using Saleforce for?

2.  Future of IT support
* Ad server instructions are done.
* Wiki upgrade process done, but needs continued updating
* Mailing list needs to move to OWASP hardware (waiting on #1 above)


Vote Required:

1.  Are we going to have a financial review for 2008.  The cost is 5K.  Suggestion is to skip the annual review and have full review every 3 years.

2.  What to do with invoices over 1 year old.  Send to collections?  Write off?  Current balance is $2900

3.  Do we charge Local chapters processing fees for the 60/40 split.  Currently we do not.  Proposal is to pass along the transaction fees too the chapter for paypal processing.

4.  Should we invest $2500 to support an OWASP meet up at Blackhat

5. GPC - Send 'Individual Committee Member' online form [https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=ckdDbXE0bkxPM3dkbDZvSmFNWVBGcnc6MA]
