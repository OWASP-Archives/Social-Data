| summit_attendee_bio=I spent many years on the development side of the fence working on both thick client and web-based applications.  That was mainly in the financial sector in Ireland and Switzerland.  In the early noughties somebody asked me if I had heard of this thing called "SQL Injection".  That was when I began the transition from poacher to gamekeeper, working on the security end of things. I continue to do a good deal of development.  

My first contact with OWASP was the AppSec Europe conference at Royal Holloway outside of London in 2005. Since then I have mainly been a consumer of OWASP resources, apart from giving a few talks at various chapter meetings. My goal with OWASP is to help development teams build "enough" security into their projects and to raise general awareness about OWASP and application security. That is why I believe that outreach and education type initiatives must be key aspects in the future direction of OWASP.
