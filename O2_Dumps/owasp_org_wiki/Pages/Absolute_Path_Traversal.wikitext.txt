 #REDIRECT [[Path Traversal]]

Last revision (mm/dd/yy): '''{{REVISIONMONTH}}/{{REVISIONDAY}}/{{REVISIONYEAR}}'''

==Description==
If a product expects a filename as input it is possible that it can construct an absolute path such as "/rootdir/subdir," which is then processed by the operating system to access a file or resource that is outside of a restricted path that was intended by the developer.

This is similar to path traversal but uses only "/" and not ".." to gain access.

==Risk Factors==

==Examples==

===How does the attack work?===
:The following URLs maybe are vulnerable to this attack:

 <nowiki>http://testsite.com/get.php?f=list</nowiki>
 <nowiki>http://testsite.com/get.cgi?f=2</nowiki>
 <nowiki>http://testsite.com/get.asp?f=test</nowiki>

:A simple way to execute this attack is like this:

 <nowiki>http://testsite.com/get.php?f=/var/www/html/get.php</nowiki>
 <nowiki>http://testsite.com/get.cgi?f=/var/www/html/admin/get.inc</nowiki>
 <nowiki>http://testsite.com/get.asp?f=/etc/passwd</nowiki>

:When the web server returns information about errors in a web application, it is much easier for the attacker to guess the correct locations (e.g. path to the file with a source code, which then may be displayed).
