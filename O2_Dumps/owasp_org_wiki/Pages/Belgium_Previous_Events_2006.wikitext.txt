=== JavaPolis 2006 -  Stephen de Vries - Security Sins and their Solutions ===
Stephen de Vries (project leader of the [[:Category:OWASP Java Project|OWASP Java Project]]) did a talk at [http://www.javapolis.com JavaPolis in Belgium] about "Security Sins and their Solutions" that can be viewed again online on [http://www.bejug.org/confluenceBeJUG/display/PARLEYS/Security+Sins+and+their+Solutions Parleys]. 

The talk covers the most insidious security vulnerabilities in Java Web and EE applications through practical demonstration of how to exploit these vulnerabilities and recommendations on how to prevent them. The threat posed by each vulnerability is explained and strategies for mitigating the flaw are introduced.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''[http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:OWASP_Belgium_Chapter_Meeting_-_Antwerp_-_14_Sep_2006_-_3_Business_Application_security_through_Information_Risk_Management_-_OWASPv1.2.ppt Business Application Security through Information Risk Management]'''<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;''Presentation + Discussion''<BR>
The presentation showed how ING has implemented business application security by implementing a risk management approach. By starting from the definition of risks and risk management, we have changed the program governance and project lifecycle to ensure that security is not seen as an add-on in a late stage of the project, but that the security requirements are defined in the early start of a project. By this approach the security requirements are becoming real functional requirements which are supported by the business. The net result is that security is not an after-thought anymore but totally integrated in the product and its (functional) requirements. As security requirements have become demands of the business, they are not taken out when the project is getting in time and budget constraints. These are all the positive consequences we have obtained from the method that will be explained throughout the presentation.
*20h05 - 21h00: Guy Crets, Apogado<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''[http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:OWASP_Belgium_Chapter_Meeting_-_Antwerp_-_14_Sep_2006_-_4_Secure_and_Reliable_WS_Guy_Crets.pdf Secure and Reliable Web Services]'''<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;''Presentation + Discussion''<BR>
Web Services are becoming a very popular protocol for communication between IT systems within and between organizations.  Web services offer a nice alternative for all sorts of communication middleware. The security of Web Services is a major attention point, now being well addressed with the WS-Security standards. Guy Crets not only explains what WS-Security is, but also opens up the subject by addressing many related topics: how does WS-* compare to B2B protocols such as EDIINT AS2, why not use SOAP over email or FTP, the importance of WS-Addressing, shortcomings in WS-ReliableMessaging, what is the importance of Microsoft WCF (aka Indigo), ...  and many more.

Can "Agile" Development Produce Secure Applications?<br>
Received wisdom has it that secure development and agile processes do <br>
not mix. Is that really so? Agile practices have proven in many <br>  
projects to yield applications with fewer functional defects. Can they <br>
also be put to work to reduce the number of security vulnerabilities?<br>
The audience added to the discussion with questions and remarks!<br>
