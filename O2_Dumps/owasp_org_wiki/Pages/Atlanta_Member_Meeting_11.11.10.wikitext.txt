'''ABSTRACT:: ''' 

Looking all around us attackers continue to break into systems, steal information and cause significant damage for organizations of any size. Many think that attackers are more sophisticated and no matter what they do an organization cannot protect itself. The major problem is that organizations are doing good things but they are not doing the right things. By understanding future trends, threat and vulnerabilities, organizations can better align themselves to build more effective defensive measures. This talk will discuss the future trends and then describe effective security measures that can be deployed today to protect an organization.
