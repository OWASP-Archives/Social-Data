* need for bylaw governance umbrella / local template
* what are examples - red cross/ wikimedia? - issa / isaca - examples
* need for clear treasurer roles
* what about local liability - what are conditions - to be put online
* A big hassle to organize local events in some countries (e.g. Brazil, Slovakia)
* The Samy Kampkar tour to be replicated!
