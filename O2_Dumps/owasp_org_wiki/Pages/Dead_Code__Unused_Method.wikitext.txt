==Description==

This method is never called or is only called from other dead code.



==Risk Factors==

TBD

==Examples==


===Example 1===

In the following class, the method doWork() can never be called.

<pre>
	public class Dead {
	  private void doWork() {
		System.out.println("doing work");
	  }
	  public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("running Dead");
	  }
	}
</pre>

===Example 2===

In the following class, two private methods call each other, but since neither one is ever invoked from anywhere else, they are both dead code.

<pre>
	public class DoubleDead {
	  private void doTweedledee() {
		doTweedledumb();
	  }
	  private void doTweedledumb() {
		doTweedledee();
	  }
	  public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("running DoubleDead");
	  }
	}
</pre>

(In this case it is a good thing that the methods are dead: invoking either one would cause an infinite loop.)
