# To help project leaders and participants with their projects in any way that I can.

== Featured Item: Proposed OWASP Project Assessment==
* OWASP has begun the process of stabilization its [[:Category:OWASP Project Assessment|'''PROJECT ASSESSMENT CRITERIA''']]. The objective is to have clear and objective requirements for OWASP project's (for both tools and documentation). 
** The current structure is still in flux, so please spend some time reviewing it and send us your comments.
