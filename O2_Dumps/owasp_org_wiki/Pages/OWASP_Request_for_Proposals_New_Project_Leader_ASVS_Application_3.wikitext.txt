| Proposed_Roadmap_Text =
As one of the founding authors of the OWASP Testing Guide, I see the potential and need for a mature and industry accepted ASVS Project. ASVS has the potential to become an industry standard reference, to get there I think it needs: marketing, public acceptance by industry heavyweights and strict quality control of the current content. My aim as leader would be to drive the marketing campaign and discuss with as many big industry players about the benefits of adopting ASVS.
