Could be you! 

== CPE Credits  ==

Much of the content is eligible for CPE credits. Please check with your institution regarding specific requirements. 

'''The CISM cpe policy (www.isaca.org/cismcpepolicy) states''': 

One continuing professional education hour is earned for each fifty minutes of active participation (excluding lunches and breaks) in a professional educational activity. Continuing professional education hours are only earned in full-hour increments and rounding must be down. For example, a CISA who attends an eight-hour presentation (480 minutes) with 90 minutes of breaks will earn seven (7) continuing professional education hours. 

Activities that qualify for CPE must be directly applicable to the management, design or assessment of an enterprise's information security as per the CISM job practice"
