   Glendale, CA

Cloud computing is an unstoppable meme at the CIO level, and will dominate corporate IT planning for the next several years. Although they do offer the promise of cost savings for many organizations, the basic ideas behind abstracting out the corporate datacenter greatly complicates the tasks of securing and auditing these systems. While there has been excellent research into low-level hypervisor and virtualization bugs, there has been little public discussion of the “big picture” problems for cloud computing. These include virtualized network devices, browser same-origin issues, credential management and many interesting legal challenges. 

Our goal with this talk will be to explore the different attack scenarios that exist in the cloud computing world and to provide a comparison between the security models of the leading cloud computing platforms. We will discuss how current attacks against applications and infrastructure are changed with cloud computing, as well as introduce the audience to new types of vulnerabilities that are unique to cloud computing. Attendees will learn how to analyze the threat posed to them by cloud computing platforms as either providers or consumers of software built on these new platforms. Our platforms for discussion include Salesforce.com, Google Apps, Microsoft Office Live, Google AppEngine, Microsoft Azure, Amazon EC2, and Sun. 

<br>Alex Stamos is a founding partner of iSEC Partners, a strategic digital security organization. Alex is an experienced security engineer and consultant specializing in application security and securing large infrastructures, and has taught multiple classes in network and application security. 

He is a leading researcher in the field of web application and web services security and has been a featured speaker at top industry conferences such as Black Hat, CanSecWest, DefCon, SyScan, Microsoft BlueHat and OWASP App Sec.

<br>Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) are not a new concept, and can help any organization better control network access. I will present some of the previous issues identified, what was the root cause, and how these have been fixed in current technology. In addition we will talk about how this can help to enhance security in your environment, and what controls must be in place in order to implement such an environment. We will also touch on how this can complicate your application environment, but improve overall security. 

I will touch on the controls that need to be reviewed and audited when working with VMware, VLANs, and web applications, to ensure that these networks are secure, and what to look for to potentially pass audit criteria. I will also talk about where and how these controls have been implemented in order to protect thousands of users while accessing one of the most hostile networks in the world. <br><br>

<br>As the line between desktop and web applications becomes increasingly blurry in a web 2.0 world, browser functionality is being pushed well beyond what it was originally intended for. Persistent client side storage has become a requirement for web applications if they are to be available both online and off. This need is being filled by a variety of technologies such as Gears (formerly Google Gears) and the Database Storage &lt;http://webkit.org/blog/126/webkit-does-html5-client-side-database-storage/&gt; functionality included in the emerging HTML 5 &lt;http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html&gt; specification. While all such technologies offer great promise, it is clear that the vast majority of developers simply do not understand their security implications. 

Researching a variety of currently deployed implementations of these technologies has revealed a broad scope of vulnerabilities with frightening implications. Now attackers can target victims not just once, but every time they visit a site as the victim now carries and stores the attack with them. Imagine a scenario whereby updated confidential information is forwarded to an attacker every time a victim interacts with a given web application. The attacker no longer needs to worry about timing their attacks to ensure that the victim is authenticated as the victim attacks himself! Limited storage? Cookies that expire? Not a problem when entire databases are accessible with virtually unlimited storage and an infinite lifespan. Think these attacks are theoretical? Think again. In this talk we dive into these technologies and break down the risk posed by them when not properly understood. We will then detail a variety of real-world vulnerabilities that have been uncovered, including a new class of cross-site scripting and client-side SQL injection. <br><br>

Michael Sutton,Vice President and security research at Zscaler, has spent more than a decade in the security industry conducting leading-edge research, building teams of world-class researchers and educating others on a variety of security topics.

*[http://www.owasp.org/images/b/bc/Watching_software_run_11.18.09.pptx Watching Software Run with Brian Chess, Fortify Founder and Chief Scientist]

<br>Now more than ever before, computer systems are vulnerable because software is vulnerable. No matter how good programmers get at making secure software, it will never be perfect—we will always have to contend with incomplete or inadequate code. Most efforts at living with bad code have focused on shoring it up from the outside: limiting network access (firewalls) or watching for suspicious behavior (intrusion detection). This talk takes a different perspective: we’ll look at methods for identifying and blunting the effects of software shortcomings from the inside by watching the software run. 

Modern languages like Java and C# are good for more than just programmers. They also provide a wealth of structured information when they execute. We can apply many same techniques developed for outside-in security, but at a finer granularity and with much more context. Along the way there is a lot to talk about: Where web application firewalls excel and where they fall down. Fuzzing vs. static analysis. The disappointments of both aspect oriented programming and building security in. Why nobody uses the Java Security model. Taking your security with you into the cloud. The reason SQL injection won’t go away. Revenge of the reference monitor. Why was Twitter’s security so bad? <br><br>

Brian Chess is a founder of Fortify Software and serves as Fortify's Chief Scientist, where his work focuses on practical methods for creating secure systems. His book, Secure Programming with Static Analysis, shows how static source code analysis is an indispensable tool for getting security right. Brian holds a Ph.D. in computer engineering from the University of California at Santa Cruz, where he studied the application of static analysis to the problem of finding security-relevant defects in source code. Before settling on security, Brian spent a decade in Silicon Valley working at huge companies and small startups. He has done research on a broad set of topics, ranging from integrated circuit design all the way to delivering software as a service. <br><br>

*[http://www.owasp.org/images/c/ca/ISO27001_OWASPLA_Shankar_10212009.pdf Enabling Compliance Requirements using Information Security Management System (ISMS) Framework (ISO27001)]

<br>Growing threats and complex regulatory requirements emphasize the need for an effective Information Security Management System (ISMS) framework for an organization. Comprehensive and globally accepted standards like ISO27001 can help in protecting information assets and in enabling compliance requirements. ISO27001 provides an Information Security framework based on best practices and controls to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information assets. This presentation analyzes the possible synergies between the goals of Information Security Management System (ISMS) and the various compliance requirements, thus making the compliance efforts less complex. <br>Following are the key objectives of this presentation&nbsp;: 

*Provide an introduction to ISO27001 and its controls 
*Discuss the implementation approach for an Information Security Management System (ISMS) framework 
*Familiarize the audience with some common challenges in implementation 
*Outline synergy between ISO27001 controls and some compliance requirements( PCI , etc)

<br>Attendees will learn about ISO27001 Information Security Standard, ISMS implementation approach and how ISO27001 can be used in meeting various regulatory/compliance requirements like Sox, PCI etc. It will also help the attendees to improve the information security posture of the organization and provide an effective and efficient approach for handling various information security/compliance audits with less effort. <br><br>

*The Rise of Threat Analysis and the Fall of Compliance, Policies, and Standards in mitigating Web Application Security Risks

<br>On August 5th of 2009, Federal prosecutors on Monday charged Albert Gonzales with the largest case of credit and debit card data theft ever in the United States: 130 million credit cards numbers by hacking into the systems of Heartland Payment Systems, the New Jersey-based card processing company, as well as Hannaford Brothers, 7-Eleven and two unnamed national retailers. Using a SQL-injection attack, the hackers installed malware on Hannaford Brothers. Hannaford was PCI compliant at the time they were compromise that lets question the validity of regulatory compliance frameworks, and specifically PCI standards as an effective method to reduce data breaches, identity theft, and the proliferation of credit card fraud. This presentation will further analyze how status quo security standards, such as PCI-DSS, as well as other policies, standards, and guidelines truly affect security risk mitigation efforts against cybercrime based threats. These traditional efforts will be compared to threat modeling workflows in order to demonstrate how real risk is mitigated under each scenario. <br><br>Cases for financial fraud will be anonymously presented to create a business case for application threat modeling as a viable methodology to drive improved application design and security risk mitigation. Threat modeling concepts will be elaborated in order to prove how application architecture walkthroughs via threat modeling improve the mitigation of cybercrime threats. Attacker motives and goals will be presented and incorporated into attack trees and it will show how attack libraries can be used to effectively identify application vulnerabilities and devise countermeasures in web application. <br><br>From the risk analysis perspective, several attacks will be considered and highlighted, particularly attacks that represent a systemic impact to an organization or government (such as for example a distributed denial of service). <br><br>Through the presentation of threat modeling scenarios, analyses and correlations will be drawn from the represented model(s) to attack patterns, associated and discovered security vulnerabilities, data sources, application topologies, and possible roles and permissions associated with the application environment. The purpose of the presentation is to demonstrate how application threat modeling can be used as part of a nouveau age form of security risk mitigation and overall application security. Data flow diagrams and application walkthroughs will enable audience members to witness how application threat modeling is an evolved form of security process engineering for improved application design and overall application security. The presentation will also demonstrate how threat modeling is capable of delivering critical business functions as well as in mitigating current and future cyber attacks, such as distributed denial of service, botnet driven-malware, spear phishing techniques, and more attacks that ultimately lead to identity and credit card fraud. <br><br>From the point of view of current and future cybercrime risk mitigation, several different strategies for application threat modeling will be discussed as related to securing both the web application web and critical financial infrastructures, such as ATMs. Finally some emphasis will be given to countermeasures that provide for incident response, intelligence and forensics capabilities. <br><br>Presentation outline, defining all topics that will be covered: 

*Status quo of regulatory compliance in mitigating risk 
*Threat modeling techniques for cybercrime threats 
*Attack tree analysis for attack tree vectors 
*Threat modeling for multi-channel fraud threat scenarios 
*Cyber crime threats and application countermeasures via threat modeling 
*Example of mitigation strategies for cybercrime and application of defense in depth for web applications

<br><br>Any supporting research/tools: 

*Threat models and attack trees 
*Threat model are produced using the Microsoft™ threat modeling tool 
*Public available cybercrime data will be presented and correlated

*The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)

<br>[http://www.opensamm.org/ The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)] is a flexible and prescriptive framework for building security into a software development organization. Covering more than typical SDLC-based models for security, SAMM enables organizations to self-assess their security assurance program and then use recommended roadmaps to improve in a way that's aligned to the specific risks facing the organization. Beyond that, SAMM enables creation of scorecards for an organization's effectiveness at secure software development throughout the typical governance, development, and deployment business functions. Scorecards also enable management within an organization to demonstrate quantitative improvements through iterations of building a security assurance program. This workshop will introduce the SAMM framework and walk through useful activities such as assessing an assurance program, mapping an existing organization to a recommended roadmap, and iteratively building an assurance program. Time allowing, additional case studies will also be discussed. SAMM is an open and free project and has recently been added under the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Foundation. <br><br>

*Cross Site Scripting, Exploits and Defenses<br><br>

For a long time, the impact of XSS vulnerabilities has been grossly underestimated. Recent compromises, such as the pro-Hillary [http://cyberinsecure.com/hacked-obama-site-redirects-visitors-to-clintons-site/ defacement] of Barack Obama's website, and a [http://www.securescience.net/twoubledtwitter.html Viral XSS in Twitter] demonstrated the impact of XSS vulnerabilities to the masses. 

During this presentation, David Campbell will demonstrate exactly how effective XSS vulns can be, and show you what you can do to protect yourself and your sites. 

This presentation was originally delivered to OWASP Colorado in May of 2008, and has been updated for this session.

[https://www.owasp.org/images/5/58/Cloud_Computing_Security.pdf Cloud Computing and Security] <br>The Cloud Computing and Software as a Service models are driving many companies to build innovative, scalable and cost effective alternatives to the traditional IT computing model. Even with the potential cost and scalability benefits of cloud computing, its use by more traditional enterprises has been retarded by the concerns of their professional security and audit staffs. In our experience these concerns are legitimate, and although surveys have shown that security is the #1 factor preventing adoption of cloud computing, there has been very little reliable discussion of the technical security risks inherent in the model and how engineers, sys-admins and architects can deal with these risks. <br><br>In this session, we will explore the widely differing security models of the leading cloud computing providers, including Amazon, Google and Salesforce. We will also reveal the significant differences in operational and application security practices necessary to deal with a cloud computing environment. <br><br>Alex Stamos is a co-founder and Partner at iSEC Partners Inc., a strategic digital security organization.

Building Security into the Test Organization <br>The common approach to detecting web security issues is still the regular application of a post-release pen-test or tool based scan. These last minute examinations rarely live up to broader organizational goals; they can be difficult to repeat, measure, or optimize over time. Most of all they're expensive: they find bugs late in the lifecycle. This talk recommends moving security testing responsibility within the test team itself. The approach discussed will work with-or-without the existence of explicit security requirements. See how security testing has been applied at other organizations and how it might be customized for yours. <br><br>Ben Walther firmly believes testers have a wonderfully devious mindset, and has been promoting the idea of "security testing" at Cigital's clients, at OWASP events, and to any friends and relatives who will listen. To this end, with the aid of O'Reilly media, Ben Walther and Paco Hope recently published a book entitled the "Web Security Testing Cookbook." <br><br>

A new web attack vector: [http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/Security-Researcher-to-Reveal-New-Web-Attack-Vector/ Script Fragmentation]<br><br>

This presentation will introduce a new web-based attack vector which utilizes client-side scripting to fragment malicious web content.<br>

This involves distributing web exploits in a asynchronous manner to evade signature detection. Similar to TCP fragmentation attacks, which are still an issue in current IDS/IPS products, This attack vector involves sending any web exploit in fragments and uses the already existing components within the web browser to reassemble and execute the exploit.<br>

Our presentation will discuss this attack vector used to evade both gateway and client side detection. We will show several proof of concepts containing common readily available web exploits.<br><br>

Entitlements Management: Security and policies for SOA using XML appliances<br><br>

Loosely coupled Web Services can be insecure as, by their very nature, are exposed to application consumers. Security built into XML appliances alleviates the developer with the burden of coding security and policies into their application, freeing the developer to concentrate on conding business processes. This evenings meeting will discuss SOA security challenges and introduce the Layer7 XML appliance that allows for dynamic policies to be configured on the fly using an intuitive user interface. <br><br>Jonathan Gershater’s career started at 3Com, managing servers and networks.

The web hacking incident database (WHID) 2007 Report is a Web Application Security Consortium project dedicated to maintaining a list of web applications related security incidents. The database classifies each reported attack by, among other criteria, the method used, the outcome of the attack and the industry and the country of the attacked organization. Based on the database Breach Labs which sponsors WHID issues a periodical report on trends in Web Application Security. 

<br>

By providing answers to questions such as: 

*The drivers behind Web hacking. 
*The technology hackers use. 
*The types of organizations attacked most often. 
*The common outcomes

<br>The presentation will discuss WHID statistics, focusing on rising trends in Web Attacks in the 1st half of 2008. As the WHID enables research into the business model behind hacking, the presentation goes beyond discussing the technical aspects of attacks such as SQL injection crawlers and Web Site herding, to discussing the business model common to all of the attacks: Economy of scale. <br><br>

"Don't Write Your Own Security Code" – Application security is arguably the most difficult IT challenge facing organizations today. There are over 600 different categories of vulnerabilities to avoid and they are all tricky. Most of these problems are related to the design, implementation, and use of a relatively small set of security controls. To solve this problem for developers, Jeff created the OWASP ESAPI project – a clean intuitive toolbox of the core security building blocks that every web developer needs. In this talk, Jeff will show you how to create an ESAPI for your organization that will solve the OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities, increase assurance, and dramatically cut costs all at the same time. 

<br>Jeff Williams is the founder and CEO of Aspect Security, specializing in application security services. Jeff also serves as the volunteer Chair of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP).
