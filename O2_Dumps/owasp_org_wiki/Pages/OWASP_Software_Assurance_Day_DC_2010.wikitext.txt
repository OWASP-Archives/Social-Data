====Welcome====  

Welcome to the '''OWASP Software Assurance Day DC 2010''' wiki page.

This single-day training session will be held on '''September 27th''' as a part of the '''13th Semi-Annual Software Assurance Forum''' (September 27th - October 1st) sponsored by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Defense (DoD) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The event will be held at the NIST campus in Gaithersburg Maryland.

We are pleased to invite OWASP members, attendees of the Software Assurance Forum and any other interested parties to join us for this event. 

At this day-long training, OWASP will be answering the questions of:
*How do I get started in formulating an application security program using OWASP tools and resources?
*What does OWASP have to offer for those interested in software assurance?
*How do I engage with OWASP to effectively realize OWASP's potential and the wealth of resources OWASP makes freely available?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(This will include upcoming OWASP events and contact information for local chapters in the DC/NOVA/Maryland area)

This day is a part of the [https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov/bsi/events/1133-BSI.html 13th Semi-Annual Software Assurance Forum]. '''The week-long event is free and open, but requires registration for participation in any or all days of the event, including the OWASP day on the 27th.'''
