This is the landing page for the UK chapters. In the past few years we have grown from only one chapter to seven. This incedible growth is due to the fantastic efforts of those involved and the support we get from all OWASP chpater attendees. If you feel you can contribute to a chapter then please get in touch with the appropriate chapter leaders who will be more than happy to engage with you or your organisation.

There is a mailing list specifically for UK Chapter leaders, and anyone else interested in getting involved with chapter meetings: https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-uk-leaders - anyone is welcome to sign up to this list.
