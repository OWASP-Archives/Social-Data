| notes_reason_for_participating_issues_to_be_discussed_1 = I'm already giving lectures and workshops on various education instances in the Netherlands about OWASP. I would like to contribute on how we can streamline the use of material, how to get both the educators and students to participate and what we can do to help with projects, papers and research in general.

| notes_reason_for_participating_issues_to_be_discussed_2 = Having developed and teached several secure coding courses, I noticed some patterns in the way programmers are thinking. I think we should address the problem on a higher level indepentant of implementation. For instance 'how should you talk to an interpreter' loose from the fact that doing it wrong can result in XSS and injection flaws. Otherwise we are just blacklisting programming errors and won't prevent future security problems.
