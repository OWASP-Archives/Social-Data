This page should collect together any resources relating to [http://www.perl.org/ Perl] and OWASP or security in general. 

It is perhaps odd that this page is so new: 

#Perl has long been an [http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/DAPM/perl-5.10.1/Artistic open source language] and often associated with the internet. 
#It offers what seems to be a much under-used method of combating many sorts of exploit namely [http://search.cpan.org/~dapm/perl-5.10.1/pod/perlsec.pod#Taint_mode taint] mode. This forces every "input" to the program to be checked for malign influences before it is allowed to effect the "outside" of the program.

== Possible perl OWASP projects  ==

#Perl ports of multi-language OWASP projects, for example [[AntiSamy]]. 
#Review of CPAN modules according to OWASP standards, for example [http://search.cpan.org/~silasmonk/CGI-Application-Plugin-Authentication-0.17/lib/CGI/Application/Plugin/Authentication.pm CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication]. 
#A perl module to measure the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength strength of passwords].

== Perl resources  ==

#[[OWASP ESAPI Perl Project]] has been started.

== Perl modules  ==
An attempt to list and classify perl modules related to web security. This should lead on to discussion of vulnerabilities.

=== Web frameworks  ===

Authentication modules will often be framework specific so let's list those.

| [http://www.catalystframework.org/ Catalyst]

| The same module also covers authorization via the concept of realms.<br> 
| Catalyst seems to have issues with taint mode.

=== Authentication<br>  ===

A lot of generic authentication modules can be found on [http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Authen&mode=all CPAN]. 

Also [http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/LDS/HTTPD-User-Manage-1.66/user_manage.html HTTPD::User::Manage].<br> 

=== Authorization  ===

I am not aware of anything generic. 

=== HTML validation/cleanup  ===

Anything similar to [[AntiSamy]] should go here. 

[http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?HTML::Scrubber HTML::Scrubber] 

There is a discussion on this subject going on at [http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=861639 PerlMonks:Dynamic HTML cleanup].



=== Password strength  ===

[http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Data::Password::Entropy Data::Password::Entropy]<br>

=== CAPTCHA alternatives ===
These are attempts to distinguish human and robot users. CAPTCHA is not perfect at this and is highly inaccessible.
