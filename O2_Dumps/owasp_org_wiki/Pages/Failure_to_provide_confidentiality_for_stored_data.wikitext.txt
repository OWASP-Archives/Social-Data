==Description==

Non-final public fields should be avoided, if possible, as the code is easily tamperable.

'''Consequences'''

* Integrity: The object could potentially be tampered with.
* Confidentiality: The object could potentially allow the object to be read.

'''Exposure period'''

* Implementation: This flaw is a simple logic issue, introduced entirely at implementation time.

'''Platform'''

* Languages: Java, C++
* Operating platforms: Any

'''Required resources'''

Any

'''Severity'''

Medium

'''Likelihood of exploit'''

High


If a field is non-final and public, it can be changed once their value is set by any function which has access to the class which contains the field.


==Risk Factors==

TBD

==Examples==

In C++:

<pre>
public int password r = 45;
</pre>

In Java:

<pre>
public String r = new String("My Password");
</pre>

Now this field is readable from any function and can be changed by any function.
