As one of their 2011 initiatives, the Global Conferences Committee started a Conference Liaison Program, where a member of the committee is paired with each of the Global AppSec organizing teams in order to assist them with their planning process as well as attend the conference to help trouble shoot any issues and sign necessary paperwork.


'''The following duties were initially set forth for the GCC liaison:'''

The GCC member shall:
*interface with the local planning committee at least 1 month before trip (attend planning call)
*Interact with planners/attendees while at conference
*Interact with Sponsors
*Sign conference contracts under $20,000 (once approved)

At the GCC meeting following the event, the traveling member will be expected to provide an post trip report covering:
*Assessment of facility
*Event Marketing Strategy
*Examination of Event Budget
*Estimation of Speaker Quality
*Sponsor engagement/cost-effectiveness & feedback
*Any notable comments from planners/attendees
*Any unique outstanding elements
*Any issues
