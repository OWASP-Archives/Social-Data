'''AGENDA'''
<br><br>
'''Title:''' OWASP Limerick - introduction, objectives, meeting agenda
<br><br><br>
19:05 - 19:50<br>
'''Title:''' '''HTML5 - A Whole New Attack Vector''' - presented by Robert McArdle  
<br> 
'''Abstract:''' HTML5 opens up a wide and wonderful new world for Web Designers to explore - bringing fantastic new features that were previously only possible via Flash or horribly over-complicated Javascript. And HTML5 is not a future technology - chances are your favourite browser already has excellent support built in (unless you are still using IE).
In this talk we will look at HTML5 from an attackers view-point. Because not only does HTML5 bring us Semantic web, editable content, inbuilt form validation, local storage, awesome video support and the long overdue death of <div> - it also opens up a host of new opportunities for attackers.
We'll look at some of the troublesome new attacks that this new HTML5 standard introduces, how attackers can leverage these attacks to cause untold havoc on your machine, and how - with a little bit of help from some not so over-complicated Javascript - we can build Botnets in your Browser!
<br> 
'''Presenter:''' Robert is currently working as the manager of Trend Micro's Advanced Threat Research team in Europe, where he is involved in analyzing the latest malware threats, specializing in researching the future threat landscape and criminal underground. Robert is a regular presenter for the press and at security conferences. He has also written and lectures an MSc module in Malware Analysis at Cork IT and UCD, and is a trainer for several SANS qualifications. A graduate of Trinity and DCU he holds several qualifications from SANS and serves on the SANS advisory board. 
<br><br><br> 
19:50 - 20:05<br>
'''Title:''' '''EU Data Protection Reform''' - presented by Niall Ahern
<br> 
'''Abstract:''' In the almost 20 years since the introduction of the EU Data Protection Directive our understanding of personal privacy has been changed by globalisation, the commercialisation of personal data, digitisation and social media. In response the European Commission intends to introduce new uniform EU wide Regulations for Data Protection.  This presentation will consider the proposed changes, their potential commercial consequences and benefits. 
<br> 
'''Presenter:''' Niall works in Dell’s Compliance and Information Security group. For the past 6 years he has been a member of a Limerick based team covering compliance, policy and risk for Dell IT globally. In the real-world he enjoys rowing, running and rugby, all pleasant distraction from being a CPI Internal Security Assessor and successfully completing the wearisome ISACA CISM exam.
<br><br><br>
