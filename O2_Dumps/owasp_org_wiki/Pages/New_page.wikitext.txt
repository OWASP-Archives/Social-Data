'''Notes:'''
*We need to define for prospective members "What is the benefit for me to join your organization?" - Ludovic
*PR proposal was presented by Bill Lessard from PR with Brains    
*Helen suggests that a "must have" list be created and then prioritized. Once completed the members from both committees can                 discuss a workable plan to complete each task.
*We need PR for local chapters which will help raise memberships/sponsorship and for our global conferences/training events - Tom Brennan
