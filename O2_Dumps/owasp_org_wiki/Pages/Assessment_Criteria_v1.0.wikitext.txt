The following defines the quality levels for OWASP TOOLS and DOCUMENTATION (Projects). Rating projects against these criteria aid in recognizing excellent contributions and identifying projects in need of further work. [[:Category:OWASP_Project | All existing OWASP projects and their current ratings are here]].

The Tool ratings are reasonably complete. The documentation rates still need to be developed.

All Beta Quality Requirements plus:
* Be reasonably easy to use
* Include online documention built into tool (based on required user documentation)
* Include build scripts that facilitate building the application from source (Goal: One-click build)
* Publicly accessible bug tracking system established, ideally at the same place as the source code repository (e.g., at Google code, or Sourceforge)
* Be run through [https://opensource.fortify.com/teamserver/welcome.fhtml Fortify Software's open source review] (if appropriate) and [http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/ FindBugs].
**WebGoat would not be appropriate for example since it would light up like a Christmas tree :-)
* C/C++ apps (if we have any) should consider being run through [http://scan.coverity.com/ Coverity's open source review]. Coverity also accepts submissions for open source Java applications.
* When approved to be Release Quality: Update the link to it on: the [[:Category:OWASP_Project | OWASP Project]] page and update [[:Category:OWASP Release Quality Tool|its project quality tag]] on its project page to be Release Quality.
'''Recommendations:'''
* Conference style Powerpoint presentation that describes the use and status of the tool. (This could be used by others to discuss the tool at OWASP Chapter meetings, serve as easy to review offline documentation, etc.)
* UAT pass on functionality of the tool
* Developer documents any limitations
 | style="width:20%; background:#e6e6e6" align="left"|
* '''Requirement''': 2 Reviewers + 1 OWASP Board Member.
** If possible, the project's lead should suggest two Project Reviewers.  One of them should be an OWASP Project or Chapter Leader.
** If the project's lead can't find the Project Reviewers, the OWASP Board will identify them. The same will happen whenever the reviewers suggested do not have the required approval.

== FAQ ==

; 1. What is the purpose of the project ratings? : The rating system allows OWASP to monitor the quality of Projects in our subject areas, and to prioritize work on these projects.  It is also utilized to prepare for static releases of Wikipedia content.  
; 2. How do I add a project (tool or documentation) to the OWASP Projects? : To propose a new project, please send an email to [mailto:owasp@owasp.org?subject=New_OWASP_Project_idea OWASP].
; 3. How does the assessment scale work? : Each category has a set of requirements/criteria to be met. Beta Quality implies that all of its requirements, as well as the Alpha Quality requirement have been met. Release Quality implies that all of the requirements, including Alpha and Beta, have been met. 
; 4. Who can assess projects? : [mailto:paulo.coimbra@owasp.org The OWASP Project Manager] can assign you a reviewer.
; 5. Why didn't the reviewer leave any comments? : Unfortunately, due to the volume of projects that need to be assessed, we are unable to leave detailed comments in most cases.  If you have particular questions, you might ask the person who assessed the project; they will be happy to provide you with their rationale.
; 6. What if I don't agree with a rating? : You can list it in the [[:Category:OWASP Project Assessment#Requests for assessment|section for assessment requests]] below, and someone will take a look at it.  Alternatively, you can ask any member of the project to rate the project again.  
; 7. Aren't the ratings subjective? : Yes, they are somewhat subjective, but it's the best system we've been able to devise.  If you have a better idea, please don't hesitate to let us know!
; 8. What if I have a question not listed here? : If your question concerns the project assessment process specifically, please contact [mailto:owasp@owasp.org OWASP] or its [mailto:paulo.coimbra@owasp.org Project Manager] directly.
