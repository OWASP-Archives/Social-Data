|  Module_Overview_Goal =
WebSlayer is a tool designed for bruteforcing Web Applications, it can be used for finding not linked resources (directories, servlets, scripts, etc), bruteforce GET and POST parameters, bruteforce Forms parameters (User/Password), Fuzzing, etc.   

The tools have a payload generator and a easy and powerful results analyzer.

&nbsp;

Some features are: 

* Encodings: 15 encodings supported
* All parameters attack: the tool will inject the payload in every parameter (Headers, Get, Post)
* Authentication: Webslayer supports Ntml and Basic authentication, also you can brute force the authentication 
* Multiple payloads: you can use 2 paylods in different parts
* Proxy support (authentication supported) 
* Live filters: You can change the filters as the attack is taking place
* Multiple threads: You can set how many threads to use in the attack
* Session import/export: Allows you to save the session and to continue working with the results 
* Integrated web browser: a full fledge webkit browser is included to analyze the results 
* Predefined dictionaries for predictable resource location, based on known servers (Thanks to Dark Raver, www.open-labs.org) 
* Payload Generator (custom payload generator)
