==== Main  ====

At the moment exchanging data between pentest tools it is far too difficult. 

So ... the purpose of this project is to define a simple, open format for exchanging data between pentest tools!

Involvement is encouraged, so if you would like to contribute to this project then please join the [https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-data-exchange-format mailing list] and / or contact one of the project leaders.

Theres also a Google Code project http://code.google.com/p/owasp-def/ which we're using to store things like example formats used by pentest products.
Contact [[User:Psiinon|Simon]] or [[User:Dinis_Cruz|Dinis]] to get commit access to this project.

=== Requirements  ===

The format must be open, and licensed so that it can be adopted by all products, whether open, closed, free or commercial. 

It must be as simple to adopt as possible, and ideally based on existing open formats. 

==== Roadmap  ====

The high level roadmap is:

# Psiinon to document a strawman proposal
# All - rip the strawman to pieces and agree an improved format
# Finalize DEF v1.0
# Supporting project leaders to adopt the format in their tools
# Publicize and drive adoption in other tools
# Learn from our experiences and start on the next version, repeat ;)

==== Strawman  ====

This tab documents a strawman proposal for all concerned to rip to pieces :)
