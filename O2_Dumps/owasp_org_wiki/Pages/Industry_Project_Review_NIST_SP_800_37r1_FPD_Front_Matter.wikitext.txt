The Information Technology Laboratory ([http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:ITL ITL]) at the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology National Institute of Standards and Technology] (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical leadership for the nation's measurement and standards infrastructure. [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:ITL ITL] develops tests, test methods, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Reference_Data reference data], proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the development and productive use of information technology. ITL's responsibilities include the development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for the cost-effective security and privacy of other than [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:National_Security-Related_Information national security-related information] in federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL's research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities with industry, government, and academic organizations.

==Authority==
</center>

This publication has been developed by NIST to further its statutory responsibilities under the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:Federal_Information_Security_Management_Act Federal Information Security Management Act] (FISMA), Public Law ([http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:P.L. P.L.]) 107-347. NIST is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements for federal information systems, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:National_Security_Systems national security systems] without the express approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy authority over such systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Office_of_Management_and_Budget Office of Management and Budget] (OMB) [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:Circular_A-130 Circular A-130], Section 8b(3), Securing Agency Information Systems, as analyzed in [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:Circular_A-130 Circular A-130], Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental information is provided in [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:Circular_A-130 Circular A-130], Appendix III.

Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made mandatory and binding on federal agencies by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Secretary_of_Commerce Secretary of Commerce] under statutory authority. Nor should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Secretary_of_Commerce Secretary of Commerce], Director of the OMB, or any other federal official. This publication may be used by nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:United_States United States].

== Compliance with NIST Standards and Guidelines ==
</center>

In accordance with the provisions of FISMA,<ref>The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:E-Government_Act E-Government Act] ([http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:P.L._107-347 P.L. 107-347]) recognizes the importance of information security to the economic and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:National_Security national security] interests of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:United_States United States]. Title III of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:E-Government_Act E-Government Act], entitled the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:Federal_Information_Security_Management_Act Federal Information Security Management Act] (FISMA), emphasizes the need for organizations to develop, document, and implement an organization-wide program to provide security for the information systems that support its operations and assets.</ref> the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Secretary_of_Commerce Secretary of Commerce] shall, on the basis of standards and guidelines developed by NIST, prescribe standards and guidelines pertaining to federal information systems. The Secretary shall make standards compulsory and binding to the extent determined necessary by the Secretary to improve the efficiency of operation or security of federal information systems. Standards prescribed shall include information security standards that provide minimum information [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Requirements security requirements] and are otherwise necessary to improve the security of federal information and information systems.

*    [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Federal_Information_Processing_Standards Federal Information Processing Standards] (FIPS) are approved by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Secretary_of_Commerce Secretary of Commerce] and issued by NIST in accordance with FISMA. FIPS are compulsory and binding for federal agencies.<ref>The term agency is used in this publication in lieu of the more general term organization only in those circumstances where its usage is directly related to other source documents such as federal legislation or policy.</ref> FISMA requires that federal agencies comply with these standards, and therefore, agencies may not waive their use.
*    Special Publications (SPs) are developed and issued by NIST as recommendations and guidance documents. For other than [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:National_Security national security] programs and systems, federal agencies must follow those NIST Special Publications mandated in a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Federal_Information_Processing_Standard Federal Information Processing Standard]. [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:FIPS_200 FIPS 200] mandates the use of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:Special_Publication_800-53 Special Publication 800-53], as amended. In addition, OMB policies (including OMB [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Reporting Reporting] Instructions for FISMA and Agency Privacy Management) state that for other than [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:National_Security national security] programs and systems, federal agencies must follow certain specific NIST Special Publications.<ref>While federal agencies are required to follow certain specific NIST Special Publications in accordance with OMB policy, there is flexibility in how agencies apply the guidance. Federal agencies should apply the security concepts and principles articulated in the NIST Special Publications in accordance with and in the context of the agency's missions, business functions, and environment of operation. Consequently, the application of NIST guidance by federal agencies can result in different security solutions that are equally acceptable, compliant with the guidance, and meet the OMB definition of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Adequate_Security adequate security] for federal information systems. When assessing [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Federal_Agency federal agency] compliance with NIST Special Publications, Inspectors General, evaluators, auditors, and assessors should consider the intent of the security concepts and principles articulated within the specific guidance document and how the agency applied the guidance in the context of its mission/business responsibilities, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Operational_Environment operational environment], and unique organizational conditions.</ref>
*    Other security-related publications, including interagency reports (NISTIRs) and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:ITL ITL] Bulletins, provide technical and other information about NIST's activities. These publications are mandatory only when specified by OMB.
*    Compliance schedules for NIST security standards and guidelines are established by OMB.

== Notes to Reviewers ==
</center>

NIST [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:Special_Publication_800-37 Special Publication 800-37], Revision 1, represents the second in a series of publications being developed by the Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative. For the past three years, NIST has been working in partnership with the Office of the Director of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:National_Intelligence National Intelligence] ([http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:ODNI ODNI]), the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Department_of_Defense Department of Defense] ([http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:DOD DOD]), and the Committee on [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:National_Security_Systems National Security Systems] ([http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:CNSS CNSS]) to develop a common information security framework for the federal government and its support contractors. The initial publication produced by the task force, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:NIST_Special_Publication_800-53 NIST Special Publication 800-53], Revision 3, was historic in nature—in that it created a unified security control catalog reflecting the information [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Requirements security requirements] of both the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:National_Security national security] community and the nonnational security community. [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:NIST_Special_Publication_800-37 NIST Special Publication 800-37], Revision 1, continues the transformation by significantly changing the traditional process employed by the federal government to certify and accredit federal information systems. The revised process provides greater emphasis on: (i) building information security capabilities into information systems through the application of state-of-the-practice management, operational, and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Technical_Security technical security] controls; (ii) maintaining awareness of the security state of information systems on an ongoing basis though enhanced monitoring processes; and (iii) understanding and accepting the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation arising from the use of information systems.

The most significant change in the Final Public Draft of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:Special_Publication_800-37 Special Publication 800-37], Revision 1, is the full transformation of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Certification_and_Accreditation Certification and Accreditation] (C&A) process into the six-step [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management Risk Management] Framework ([http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:RMF RMF]). The revised [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:RMF RMF]-based process has the following characteristics:

*    Integrates information security more closely into the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Enterprise_Architecture enterprise architecture] and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Development_Life_Cycle system development life cycle];
*    Provides equal emphasis on the selection, implementation, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment], and monitoring of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls], and the authorization of information systems;
*    Establishes responsibility and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Accountability accountability] for [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] deployed within organizational information systems and inherited by those systems (i.e., common controls);
*    Links [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] processes at the information [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Level system level] to [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] processes at the organization-level through a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)];
*    Promotes the concept of near [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Real-Time real-time] [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] and ongoing information system authorization through the implementation of robust continuous monitoring processes; and
*    Encourages the use of automation and automated support tools to provide senior leaders the necessary information to take credible, risk-based decisions with regard to the organizational information systems supporting their core missions and business functions.

The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] process described in this publication changes the traditional focus from the stovepipe, organization-centric, static-based approaches to C&A and provides the capability to more effectively manage [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System-related_Security_Risks information system-related security risks] in highly dynamic environments of complex and sophisticated cyber threats, ever increasing system vulnerabilities, and rapidly changing missions.

We have worked diligently to review and adjudicate the over five hundred comments received during the initial public review process. Your feedback to us, as always, is important. We appreciate each and every contribution from our reviewers. The very insightful comments from both the public and private sectors continue to help shape our publications and ensure that they meet the needs of our customers.
