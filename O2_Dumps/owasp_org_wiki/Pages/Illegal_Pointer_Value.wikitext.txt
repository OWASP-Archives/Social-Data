==Description==

This function can return a pointer to memory outside of the buffer to be searched. Subsequent operations on the pointer may have unintended consequences.

This function can return a pointer to memory outside the bounds of the buffer to be searched under either of the following circumstances:

* An attacker can control the contents of the buffer to be searched 
* An attacker can control the value for which to search 


==Risk Factors==

TBD

==Examples==

The following short program uses an untrusted command line argument as the search buffer in a call to rawmemchr().

<pre>
	int main(int argc, char** argv) {
	  char* ret = rawmemchr(argv[0], 'x');
	  printf("%s\n", ret);
	} 
</pre>

The program is meant to print a substring of argv[0], but it may end up printing some portion of memory above argv[0].

This issue is similar to a string termination error, where the programmer relies on a character array to contain a null terminator.
