Joe's idea: Right now in OWASP we have a $5k Corporate Membership and a $50 individual membership. Maybe we should have something in the middle, for example: a $500 corporate employee membership - where there is an open disclosure but still a protection of their interests in their membership agreement. These corporate members would have access to vertical driven content, and the ability to interact with peers with similar appsec issues. (This will likely open up a can of worms regarding NDAs or other "agreement" -- So watch out!).  The idea would be to we will represent the corporate data through sanitized metrics but not disclose the source.
