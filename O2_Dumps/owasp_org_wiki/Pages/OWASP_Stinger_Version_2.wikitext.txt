==Overview==

The J2EE platform does not include any validation features. This leaves many organizations to craft their own validation mechanisms, often incomplete, flawed, and inefficient.

OWASP Stinger 2.x is an implementation of the design principals detailed in the [http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Validation_Documentation_Project OWASP Validation Documentation]. The basic idea is to define validation rules for the cookies and parameters of an HTTP request. These rules are specified in simple XML files using the 'Security Validation Definition Language.' Furthermore, Stinger 2 is implemented as a J2EE filter such that all HTTP traffic is validated ''before'' it is ever processed by the web application.
