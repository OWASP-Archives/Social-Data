'''1. April 2008 | Global OWASP Week'''<br />

The following was the official invitation mail:

<pre>

Dear Receiver,
in the name of the OWASP (http://owasp.org) I'd like to invite you to
our next event, which is part of the Global OWASP Week 2008. If you're
interested in web application security, this is something for you.


Date and time:
 1.April 2008 -> WebAppSec Is No Joke
 18:00 - ca. 21:00

Where:
 The event takes place at the ETH Zurich, in the main building, room
 HG F26.5

Who:
  As at all of our meetings, everyone is welcome. If you know someone
  who could also be interested in this event, ask him/her to come too.

Content:
  We'll have three interesting Talks.

 - Taking Apache access logs to the next level: Complying to PCI DSS
   for fun and profit
   (Christian Folini - Technical Consultant at netnea)

     The PCI DSS is rather vague, when it comes to logfiles. It does
     make clear, that writing logfiles and reading them is a
     requirement though. But it leaves it up to you to define your
     setup and your processes. Apache brings numerous logging
     possibilities, but they are rarely used in practice. Based on a
     sample enterprise setup, I will discuss key items of a
     revision-proof architecture. System components and methods will be
     examined and a few interesting techniques presented.

  - Implementing an Application Security Lifecycle programme
    (Alessandro Moretti - Executive director for IT security risk
     management at UBS Investment Bank)

     Topic:
     A case study at UBS Investment Bank - how the Application Security
     Lifecycle Programme aims to implement proactive and reactive IT
     security management and promote application security across the
     global UBS IT community.

     Short description:
     UBS IT Security Risk Management will provide an overview of the
     risk strategy, and an insight into the strategic initiative, based
     partly on OWASP, to enhance the application security with each
     phase of the software development lifecycle. The presentation will
     provide details on the vision, the overall programme approach and
     on selected deliverables as part of the programme. Topics include,
     security education, risk management, source code testing,
     penetration testing and web application firewalls. A question and
     answer session will follow.

  - WebAppSec the Big Picture
    (Sven Vetsch - Security Tester at Dreamlab Technologies)

     Most of the actual vulnerabilities which security researchers and
     also bad guys (doesn't) report every day, are related to web
     applications. Even if this is the case, the security community
     didn't get the big picture of what security related problems we've
     got through web applications. In this demonstration, we will show
     you an overview of the most important web vulnerabilities like SQL
     Injections, XSS, CSRF, Path Traversal, Session Fixation and much
     more. The focus in this demonstration is not to show you the
     latest research results in webappsec, it's to show you the big
     picture of this topic.

Sven Vetsch
Leader OWASP Switzerland

'''11. November 2006 | OWASP Switzerland Local Chapter Kickoff Meeting'''

Switzerland have a Local Chapter for a while now but there were never some meetings or some other activities. Now, a few members of the OWASP Switzerland Local Chapter mailinglist met each other in Zurich to do a real kick-off for this Chapter.

In the Switzerland Local Chapter, we decided that at the moment the most important thing for us would be to build a network of people in Switzerland which are interested in the OWASP too and at the same time to promote it that the folks which didn't know the OWASP yet will get in touch with it. In future meetings we also want to do some presentations and/or workshop for having an active knowledge transfer.
