OWASP Points are a system that allows us to recognize an individuals achievement and accomplishments in OWASP.  The system is designed to be distributed and self nominated.  

* Each [[Global Committee Pages|Global Committee]] will establish it's own criteria for assigning points for participation in the committee's area of responsibility
* The OWASP Board will establish points for areas outside committee areas of responsibility
* The Committee chairs and a board rep will meet as needed (at least quarterly) to normalize the point values
* OWASP Members will have the ability to self nominate for points
* Each Committee will be responsible for providing overnight of points claimed under their areas

==Mechanics==
Members can self-nominate for points by adding the associated "Badge" to their wiki user account.  It is the intention of the point system that any individual who reaches a total of 100 Points.  At the beginning of each year, half of all member points earned two years ago will be carried over to the next calendar year.  For example, if you earned 100 points in 2009, you would keep your points in 2010, in 2011 you would get 50 points and in 2012 these points will expire.

For example 
(add example of me in here and how many points would carry)
