'''Jeff Williams''' [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4981336955006017781&hl=en Video] | [https://www.owasp.org/images/d/d7/OWASP_MN_ESAPI.pptx Slides]<br />CEO, [http://www.aspectsecurity.com/ Aspect Security]<br />OWASP founder; Chair, OWASP Foundation<br>

Application security is getting more complicated every day with increasing connectivity, more mixing of code and data, more parsers, more interpreters, more assets, and more functionality available. We have to take steps now to simplify the problem. So if you're tired of securing one application at a time, and wrestling with the same vulnerabilities again and again, is establishing your organization's ESAPI is one of the best things you can do?

'''Bio''':
I'm Jeff Williams, I work as CEO of Aspect Security and I serve as the volunteer Chair of the OWASP Foundation. I've worked on a number of projects at OWASP, including creating the OWASP Top 10, WebGoat, Stinger, Secure Software Contract Annex, Honeycomb Project and the Enterprise Security API.

Many of the challenges we face in application security could be solved at an architectural layer without trying to accomplish the impossible task of fixing millions of websites with billions of lines of code behind them. The OWASP [[Intrinsic Security Working Group]] is a new OWASP effort focused on addressing root causes of application security problems and fixing them where it's easiest. Sometimes that means pushing a browser to include a feature, or asking a language framework to provide a new API, or helping standard-makers come up with useable security protections. 

Our goal with the OWASP ISWG is to leverage the collective security know-how of OWASP into practical advice and suggestions for all those technologies that our applications lean on in one way or another. We've got the modest goal of fixing the Internet - what could be more valuable?

'''Bio''': Arshan Dabirsiaghi is the Director of Research at Aspect Security. Arshan has over seven of years of professional experience writing code, four years of professionally auditing code, and many years of hobbying in both. At Aspect Security, Arshan performs the normal array of security assurance work, including code reviews, architecture reviews and penetration testing. He spends the balance of his work time teaching classes all over the world and doing research into next generation web application attacks and defenses.

Arshan earned his Master’s degree in Computer Science from Towson University with a focus on Information Security. He has delivered tutorials at Blackhat and OWASP conferences and has been a featured speaker at a number of security and artificial intelligence conferences. Arshan is also the author of the OWASP AntiSamy project and the founder of the OWASP Intrinsic Security Working Group.

Creating secure code requires more than just good intentions. Programmers need to know how to make their code safe in an almost infinite number of scenarios and configurations. Static source code analysis gives users the ability to review their work with a fine tooth comb and uncover the kinds of errors that lead directly to vulnerabilities. This talk frames the software security problem and shows how static analysis is part of the solution.
 
Highlights include:<br>
* The most common security short-cuts and why they lead to security failures
* Why programmers are in the best position to get security right
* Where to look for security problems
* How static analysis helps
* The critical attributes and algorithms that make or break a static analysis tool
 
We will look at how static analysis works, how to integrate it into the software development processes, and how to make the most of it during security code review.

'''Bio''': Dr. Chess's research focuses on methods for creating secure systems. He received his Ph.D. from the University of California at Santa Cruz, where he applied his background in integrated circuit test and verification to the problem of identifying security errors in software. In addition to authoring numerous patents and technical papers, Dr. Chess has more than ten years of experience in the commercial software arena, having led development efforts at Hewlett Packard and NetLedge

'''Elliot Glazer'''<br />[http://www.dtcc.com/ DTCC]

Information Security Architecture Layers and Key Processes:

* Information Security Architecture is driven by an Information Security Strategy and Principles.  It is also critical the architecture support the Business Strategy:
** Security Functional Architecture: the layout of key functions in security to be accomplished, which drives security requirements.
** Security Technical Architecture: the solutions and standards to implement key functions, usually an overlay on top of the Functional Architecture.  This is generally a definition of components, intended to be leveraged for reuse by organization, business, line of business or across the enterprise.
** Security Reference Architecture:  the implementation of Technical Architecture components into a strategy, platform, or particular complex solution set, to be used as a model for other, like needs.  This is usually a set of components organized together.
** Security Technology Lifecycle – the process of phasing in and out, technology and process solutions that improve the security environment.  Six phases ranging from researching new solutions to exiting old and failing solutions are defined.
** Security Program Implementation Planning – the process of identifying high level scheduling based on priority and available resources, for solutions defined in the Technical Architecture.  Priority is generally established based on risk.  The program also helps in the planning cycles for budgeting, as it will try to take a multiyear view.

'''Bio''': Elliott has over 25 years of information technology experience and has worked in the security field for over 10 years.  He is currently Director of Security Architecture for the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), where he has created a number of innovative solutions in the areas of security monitoring and security architecture.  He also provides consulting to the organization on critical security issues. Prior to this, Mr. Glazer was Vice President for Security Solutions at American Express, leading many large and small solutions for the Internet, Security, Privacy, and Customer Servicing.  Previous to this, Elliott held leadership positions at Citigroup, Sprint International, and BT Dialcom in software development and operations.  He has led architecture, development, and operations organizations including an enterprise architecture group, Internet software development, and distrbitured operations among others.

'''Richard Stallman'''

Richard Matthew Stallman is a software developer and software freedom activist. In 1983 he announced the project to develop the GNU operating system, a Unix-like operating system meant to be entirely free software, and has been the project's leader ever since. With that announcement Stallman also launched the Free Software Movement. In October 1985 he started the Free Software Foundation.

The GNU/Linux system, which is a variant of GNU that also uses the kernel Linux developed by Linus Torvalds, are used in tens or hundreds of millions of computers, and are now preinstalled in computers available in retail stores. However, the distributors of these systems often disregard the ideas of freedom which make free software important.

That is why, since the mid-1990s, Stallman has spent most of his time in political advocacy for free software, and spreading the ethical ideas of the movement, as well as campaigning against both software patents and dangerous extension of copyright laws. Before that, Stallman developed a number of widely used software components of the GNU system, including the original Emacs, the GNU Compiler Collection, the GNU symbolic debugger (gdb), GNU Emacs, and various other programs for the GNU operating system.

Stallman pioneered the concept of copyleft, and is the main author of the GNU General Public License, the most widely used free software license.

Stallman gives speeches frequently about free software and related topics. Common speech titles include "The GNU Operating System and the Free Software movement", "The Dangers of Software Patents", and "Copyright and Community in the Age of the Computer Networks". A fourth common topic consists of explaining the changes in version 3 of the GNU General Public License, which was released in June 2007. </td>
