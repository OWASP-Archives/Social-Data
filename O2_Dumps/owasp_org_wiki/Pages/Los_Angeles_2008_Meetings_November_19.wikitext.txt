== Abstract: A new web attack vector: [http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/Security-Researcher-to-Reveal-New-Web-Attack-Vector/ Script Fragmentation] ==

This presentation will introduce a new web-based attack vector which
utilizes client-side scripting to fragment malicious web content.<br>

This involves distributing web exploits in a asynchronous manner to
evade signature detection. Similar to TCP fragmentation attacks, which
are still an issue in current IDS/IPS products, This attack vector
involves sending any web exploit in fragments and uses the already
existing components within the web browser to reassemble and execute
the exploit.<br>

Our presentation will discuss this attack vector used to evade both
gateway and client side detection. We will show several proof of
concepts containing common readily available web exploits.<br><br>
