'''A semantic web approach to share alerts among Security Information Management Systems'''

Jorge E. López de Vergara, Víctor A. Villagrá, Pilar Holgado, Elena de Frutos, Iván Sanz

''This paper presents a semantic web-based architecture to share alerts among Security Information Management Systems (SIMS). Such architecture is useful if two or more SIMS from different domains need to know information about alerts happening in the other domains, which is useful for an early response to network incidents. For this, an ontology has been defined to describe the knowledge base of each SIMS that contains the security alerts. These knowledge bases can be queried from other SIMS, using standard semantic web protocols. Two modules have been implemented: one to insert the new security alerts in the knowledge base, and another one to query such knowledge bases. The performance of both modules has been evaluated, providing some results.''

'''WASAT - A New Web Authorization Security Analysis Tool'''

Carmen Torrano-Gimenez , Alejandro Perez-Villegas and Gonzalo Alvarez

''WASAT (Web Authentication Security Analysis Tool) is an intuitive and complete application designed for the assessment of the security of different web related authentication schemes, namely Basic Authentication and Forms-Based Authentication. WASAT is able to mount dictionary and brute force attacks of variable complexity against the target web site. Password files incorporate a syntax to generate different password search spaces. An important feature of this tool is that low-signature attacks can be performed in order to avoid detection by anti-brute-force mechanisms. This tool is platform-independent and multithreading too, allowing the user to take control of the program speed. WASAT provides some features not included in many of the existing similar applications and hardly any of their drawbacks, making this tool an excellent one for security analysis.''

'''Connection String Parameter Pollution Attacks'''

Chema Alonso, Manuel Fernandez, Alejandro Martín and Antonio Guzmán

''In 2007 the classification of the ten most critical vulnerabilities for the security of a system establishes that code injection attacks are the second type of attack behind XSS attacks. Currently the code injection attacks are placed first in this ranking. In fact Most critical attacks are those that combine XSS techniques to access systems and code injection techniques to access the information.. The potential damage associated with this type of threats, the total absence of background and the fact that the solution to mitigate this vulnerability must be implemented by systems administrators and the database vendors justify an in-depth analysis to estimate all the possible ways of implementation of this attack technique.''

'''Web Applications Security Assessment in the Portuguese World Wide Web panorama'''

Nuno Teodoro, Carlos Serrão

''Following the EU Information and Communication Technologies agenda, the Portuguese Government has started the creation of many applications, enabling electronic interaction between individuals, companies and the public administration – the e-Government. Due to the Internet open nature and the sensitivity of the data that those applications have to handle, it is important to ensure and assess their security. Financial institutions, such as banks, that nowadays use the WWW as a communication channel with their customers, face the same challenges. 
The main objective of this paper is to introduce a work that will be performed to assess the security of the financial and public administration sectors web applications. In this paper the authors provide a description of the rationale behind this work that involves the selection of a set of key financial and public administration web applications, the definition and application of a security assessment methodology, and the evaluation the assessment results.''

'''Building web application firewalls in high availability environments'''

Juan Galiana Lara, Àngel Puigventós Gracia

''Every day increases the number of Web applications and Web services due to migration that is occurring in this type of environments. In these scenarios, it is very common to find all types of vulnerabilities affecting web applications and traditional methods of protection at the network and transport level, not enough to mitigate them. What is more, there are also situations where the availability of information systems is vital for proper functioning. To protect our systems from these threats, we need a component acting on the layer 7 of the OSI model, which includes the HTTP protocol that allows us to analyze traffic and HTTPS that is easily scalable. To solve these problems, the paper presents the design and implementation of an Open Source application firewall, ModSecurity, emphasizing the use of the positive security model, and the deployment of high availability environments.''

==== Speakers  ====
=== Keynote Speakers ===

== Bruce Schneier ==
'''The Future of the Security Industry'''
Bruce Schneier is an internationally renowned security technologist and author. Described by The Economist as a "security guru," he is best known as a refreshingly candid and lucid security critic and commentator. When people want to know how security really works, they turn to Schneier.

His first bestseller, Applied Cryptography, explained how the arcane science of secret codes actually works, and was described by Wired as "the book the National Security Agency wanted never to be published." His book on computer and network security, Secrets and Lies, was called by Fortune "[a] jewel box of little surprises you can actually use." Beyond Fear tackles the problems of security from the small to the large: personal safety, crime, corporate security, national security. His current book, Schneier on Security, offers insight into everything from the risk of identity theft (vastly overrated) to the long-range security threat of unchecked presidential power and the surprisingly simple way to tamper-proof elections.

Regularly quoted in the media, he has testified on security before the United States Congress on several occasions and has written articles and op eds for many major publications, including The New York Times, The Guardian, Forbes, Wired, Nature, The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, The Sydney Morning Herald, The Boston Globe, The San Francisco Chronicle, and The Washington Post.

Schneier also publishes a free monthly newsletter, Crypto-Gram, with over 150,000 readers. In its ten years of regular publication, Crypto-Gram has become one of the most widely read forums for free-wheeling discussions, pointed critiques, and serious debate about security. As head curmudgeon at the table, Schneier explains, debunks, and draws lessons from security stories that make the news.

Schneier is the Chief Security Technology Officer of BT.

== Jorge Martín ==
Jorge Martín is an inspector of the Spanish National Police, and currently the Head of the Logical Security Group from the High-Tech Crime Unit in the Comisaria General de Policía Judicial.

He his a Computer Systems Technical Engineer and since five years now dedicates himself to police investigation in the technological area, focusing his activity on crimes related to intrusions, different types of attacks, malware creation and dissemination and other related issues. He has also a large experience on the filed of computer forensics. 

He has participated on different courses and conferences, both in Spain and abroad. Regularly participates on training initiatives with other law enforcement forces on different countries, several Interpol projects about technological investigation techniques and on different European Union studies on the obtaining and manipulation of digital evidences.

== Justin Clarke ==
'''Title''': SQL Injection - how far does the rabbit hole go?

'''Abstract''': SQL Injection has been around for over 10 years, and yet it is still to this day not truly understood by many security professionals and developers. With the recent mass attacks against sites across the world, and well publicised data breaches with SQL Injection as a component, it has again come to the fore of vulnerabilities under the spotlight, however many consider it to only be a data access issue, or parameterized queries to be a panacea. This talk explores the deeper, darker areas of SQL Injection, hybrid attacks, SQL Injection worms, and exploiting database functionality. Explore what kinds of things we can expect in future.

'''Bio''': Justin Clarke is a co-founder and Director at Gotham Digital Science, based in the United Kingdom. He has over twelve years of experience in assessing the security of networks, web applications, and wireless networks for large financial, retail, technology and government clients in the United States, the United Kingdom and New Zealand.
Justin is the lead author and technical editor of "SQL Injection Attacks and Defense" (Syngress 2009), co-author of "Network Security Tools: Writing, Hacking, and Modifying Security Tools" (O¹Reilly 2005), and a contributing author to "Network Security Assessment: Know Your Network, 2nd Edition" (O'Reilly 2007), as well as a speaker at a number of conferences and events on security topics, including Black Hat USA, BruCON, EuSecWest, OSCON, ISACA, RSA, SANS, OWASP, and the British Computer Society. He is the author of the open source SQLBrute blind SQL injection testing tool, and is the Chapter Leader for the London chapter of OWASP.

== Dinis Cruz ==
'''Title''': OWASP O2 Platform - Open Platform for automating application security knowledge and workflows

'''Abstract''': In this talk Dinis Cruz will show the OWASP O2 Platform which is an open source toolkit specifically designed for developers and security consultants to be able to perform quick, effective and thorough 'source-code-driven' application security reviews. The OWASP O2 Platform (http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_O2_Platform) consumes results from the scanning engines from Ounce Labs, Microsoft's CAT.NET tool, FindBugs, CodeCrawler and AppScan DE, and also provides limited support for Fortify and OWASP WebScarab dumps. In the past, there has been a very healthy skepticism on the usability of Source Code analysis engines to find commonly found vulnerablities in real world applications. This presentation will show that with some creative and powerful tools, it IS possible to use O2 to discover those issues. This presentation will also show O2's advanced support for Struts and Spring MVC.

'''Bio''': Dinis Cruz is the Chief OWASP Evangelist and a Security Consultant based in London (UK) and specialized in: ASP.NET Application Security, Active Directory deployments, Application Security audits and .NET Security Curriculum Development.
Since the 1.1 release of the .Net Framework, Dinis has been one of the strongest proponents of the need to write .Net applications that can be executed in secure Partially Trusted .Net environments, and has done extensive research on: Rooting the CLR, exposing the dangers of Full Trust Asp.Net Code, Type Confusion vulnerabilities in Full Trust (i.e. non verifiable) code, creating .Net Security Protection Layers and using Reflection to dynamically manipulate .Net Client applications.
Dinis is the current [Owasp .Net Project] and [OWASP Autumn of Code] project's leader and the main developer of several of OWASP .Net tools ([SAM'SHE], [ANBS], [SiteGenerator], Owasp Report Generator, [Asp.Net Reflector]).
Dinis is a active trainer on .Net security having written and delivered courses for IOActive, Foundstone, Intense School and KPMG . His latest course is the two day training course [Advanced Asp.Net Exploits and Countermeasures, which was delivered at the Black Hat 2006 conference and will be presented on the fortcomming [OWASP AppSec Conference] in Seattle.

'''Title''': The Business of Rogueware

'''Abstract''': The growth and complexity of the underground cybercrime economy has grown significantly over the past couple of years due to a variety of factors including the rise of social media tools, the global economic slowdown, and an increase in the total number of internet users. For the past 3 years, PandaLabs has monitored the ever-evolving cybercrime economy to discover its tactics, tools, participants, motivations and victims to understand the full extent of criminal activities and ultimately bring an end to the offenses. In October of 2008, PandaLabs published findings from a comprehensive study on the rogueware economy which concluded that the cybercriminals behind fake antivirus software applications were generating upwards of $15 million per month. In July of 2009, it released a follow-on study that proved monthly earnings had more than doubled to approximately $34 million through rougeware attacks distributed via Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, Digg and targeted Blackhat SEO.

== Dave Harper ==
'''Title''': Empirical Software Security Assurance

'''Abstract''': By now everyone knows that security must be built in to software; it cannot be bolted on. For more than a decade, scientists, visionaries, and pundits have put forth a multitude of techniques and methodologies for building secure software, but there has been little to recommend one approach over another or to define the boundary between ideas that merely look good on paper and ideas that actually get results. The alchemists and wizards have put on a good show, but it's time to look at the real empirical evidence.
This talk examines software security assurance as it is practiced today. We will discuss popular methodologies and then, based on in-depth interviews with leading enterprises such as Adobe, EMC, Google, Microsoft, QUALCOMM, Wells Fargo, and Depository Trust Clearing Corporation (DTCC), we present a set of benchmarks for developing and growing an enterprise-wide software security initiative, including but not limited to integration into the software development lifecycle (SDLC). While all initiatives are unique, we find that the leaders share a tremendous amount of common ground and wrestle with many of the same problems. Their lessons can be applied in order to build a new effort from scratch or to expand the reach of existing security capabilities.

'''Bio''': David Harper is the EMEA Services Director for Foritfy Software, the market leader in the fast-growing area of Software Security Assurance (SSA). SSA gives organizations the power to ensure that their entire software portfolio -- whether develop internally or acquired through 3rd parties -- is secure and free of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by cyber attackers to steal valuable data and cause mayhem.
David is responsible for helping Fortify’s European Customers establish Software Security Assurance programs to systematically reduce application risk. David has extensive experience of defining and implementing Secure Development Life-cycles, whether in response to a security breach or as part of a PCI or other compliance initiative. David has also worked as security consultant on large e-commerce web-sites.
Prior to joining Fortify, David held consultancy positions at Macrovision and Entrust Technologies. David has over 20 years experience in application development and security and is a graduate of Bristol University.

'''Title''': Authentication: choosing a method that fits

'''Abstract''': Through the last five years, we, in the security field, have been witnessing an increase in the number of attacks to (web) application user's credentials, and the refinement and sophistication these attacks have been gaining. There are currently several methods and mechanisms to increase the strength of the authentication process for web applications. To improve the user authentication process, but also to improve the transaction authentication. As an example, one can think of adding one-time password tokens, or digital certificates, EMV cards, or even SMS one-time codes. However, none of these methods comes for free, nor do they provide perfect security. Also, one must consider usability penalties, mobility constraints, and, of course, the direct costs of the gadgets. Moreover, there's evidence that not all kinds of attacks can be stopped by even the most sophisticated of these methods. So, where do we stand? What should we choose? What kind of gadgets should we use for our business critical app, how much will they increase the costs and reduce the risk, and, last but not least, what kind of attacks we’ll be unable to stop anyway? This presentation will focus on ways to figure out how to evaluate the pros and cons of adding these improvements, given the current threats.

'''Bio''': Miguel Almeida is an independent computer and network security professional. He has been testing, reviewing and advising on information security for the last ten years. His work has been focused on financial institutions and it has included engagements where, for a broad view of information security, the technical side as well as the organizational and procedural sides have been analyzed.

'''Title''': OWASP TOP 10 2009

'''Abstract''': The goal of the Top 10 project is to raise awareness about application security by identifying some of the most critical risks facing organizations. The Top 10 project is referenced by many standards, books, tools, and organizations, including MITRE, PCI DSS, DISA, FTC, and many more. The OWASP Top 10 was initially released in 2003 and minor updates were made in 2004, 2007, and this 2010 release. We encourage you to use the Top 10 to get your organization started with application security. Developers can learn from the mistakes of other organizations. Executives can start thinking about how to manage the risk that software applications create in their enterprise.

'''Title''': Protection of applications at the enterprise in the real world: from audits to controls

'''Abstract''': Securing application development in the enterprise world, where applications range from small in-house applications developed by a small department to large applications developed through an outsourcing company in a project spanning several years. In addition those applications that initially where not considered critical, suddenly become part of a critical process or those that were going to be used in a small and limited internal environment suddenly get promoted and published as a new service on the Internet.
To get a better feeling of what works and what does not work in the harsh world outside, this talk will present examples of do's and dont's coming from real world projects attempting to protect security applications in different stages: from the introduction of technical measures to prevent abuse of Internet-facing applications to source-code driven application security testing.
