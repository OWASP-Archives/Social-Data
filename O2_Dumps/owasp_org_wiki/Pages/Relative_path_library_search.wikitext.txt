==Description==

Certain functions perform automatic path searching. The method and results of this path searching may not be as expected. Example: WinExec will use the space character as a delimiter, finding "C:\Program.exe" as an acceptable result for a search for "C:\Program Files\Foo\Bar.exe".

'''Consequences'''

* Authorization: There is the potential for arbitrary code execution with privileges of the vulnerable program.

'''Exposure period'''

* Implementation: This flaw is a simple logic issue, introduced entirely at implementation time.

'''Platform'''

* Languages: Any
* Operating platforms: Any

'''Required resources'''

Any

'''Severity'''

High

'''Likelihood of exploit'''

High

If a malicious individual has access to the file system, it is possible to elevate privileges by inserting such a file as "C:\Program.exe" to be run by a privileged program making use of WinExec.


==Risk Factors==

TBD

==Examples==

In C\C++:

<pre>
UINT errCode = WinExec(
  "C:\\Program Files\\Foo\\Bar",
  SW_SHOW
);
</pre>

==Related [[Attacks]]==

* [[Attack 1]]
* [[Attack 2]]


==Related [[Vulnerabilities]]==

* [[Vulnerability 1]]
* [[Vulnerabiltiy 2]]

==Related [[Controls]]==

* Implementation: Use other functions which require explicit paths. Making use of any of the other readily available functions which require explicit paths is a safe way to avoid this problem. 


==Related [[Technical Impacts]]==

* [[Technical Impact 1]]
* [[Technical Impact 2]]
