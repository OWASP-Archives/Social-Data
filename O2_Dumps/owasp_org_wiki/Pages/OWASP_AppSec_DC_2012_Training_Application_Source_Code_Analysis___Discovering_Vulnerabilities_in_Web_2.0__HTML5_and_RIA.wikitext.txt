==Description==
'''Course Length: 1 Day'''

Enterprise application source code, independent of languages and platforms, is a major source of vulnerabilities. The class is designed and developed to focus on enterprise architecture and application analytics to discover vulnerabilities across Web 2.0, RIA and HTML5.  We will be covering analysis techniques, with tools, for assessment and review of enterprise application source code. It is imperative to know source code review methodologies and strategies for analysis. The emphasis of the class would be to develop a complete understanding of source code analysis, techniques and tools to address top set of vulnerabilities. Knowledge gained would help in analyzing and securing next generation enterprise applications at all different stages - architecture, design and/or development. The course is designed and delivered by the author of "Web Hacking: Attacks and Defenses", "Hacking Web Services" and "Web 2.0 Security - Defending Ajax, RIA and SOA", bringing his experience in application security and research to the curriculum.
