I never expected to get involved in open source. I didn't even really know very much about it when I donated WebGoat to OWASP back in 2002. I had no idea what would happen. I guess I just thought it would be cool if more people could use it to learn about application security.

Working on the first OWASP Top Ten, I started to realize the power of OWASP's independence, transparency, and openness. I discovered a community of smart, passionate, and commited researchers who believe in the importance of securing the Internet and the software that makes it happen.

Today, OWASP has grown to a worldwide organziation with over 150 chapters and thousands of volunteers. We have produced high quality books, tools, libraries, and more. We have conferences all over the world. And we've done it all because people just like you decided to help figure it out.

But we are just starting up a staggeringly big mountain. We're struggling with the easy problems while the hard problems keep piling up. And so I’m writing today to ask you to protect and sustain OWASP. Together, we can change the software market forever. We can make secure code the default and enable fantastic, amazing innovations that are difficult to even imagine today.

Each year at this time, we reach out to ask you and others all across the software community to help us ensure an Internet that's safe enough for Mom and kids, finances, defense, healthcare, and science.

If you think the software market needs OWASP as a source of truth and innovation - I hope you’ll choose to act right now.

All the best,

Jeff Williams

P.S. OWASP is about software that's safe enough to trust with your most critical information. It doesn't matter if you are 7 or 70, if you love software, we can use your help.
