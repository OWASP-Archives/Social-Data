In addition to holding meetings, you may want to grow and promote your chapter by organizing a larger event such as an OWASP Day, Training Day, or Regional Roadshow. Many of the considerations for these events are similar to that for a meeting, just on a larger scale:
*Venue
*Date and Time
*Speakers/topics
*Catering
*Promotion
*Sponsor(s)


Additionally, you will need to consider whether there will be any cost for attendees? Options include: free for anyone, free for members (so individuals would have to purchase a membership to attend), cost for everyone but discounted for members, or same cost for everyone. The best way to plan for these events is to look at what some chapters have done in the past and try and talk to the chapter leader or event organizer who was involved.


Please register your event through the [https://ocms.owasp.org/ OWASP Conference Management System (OCMS)], which will help OWASP track events not only hosted by OWASP but also sponsored or supported by Foundation funds. The Global Chapters Committee and Global Conferences Committee are also willing to help with your event planning.


==Local OWASP Days== 
Many OWASP Chapters (or a group of chapters in the same region) have planned an OWASP Day which consists of a full day of talks about AppSec and sometimes and additional day of training, provided for little or no cost. The primary goals of OWASP Days are to educate people and raise awareness about application security, not make money.

==OWASP Training Days==
OWASP Training Days are full day training courses that are free for members (so non-members can attend by paying the $50 fee to becoming members). The course aims to educate people about OWASP Projects by providing a selection of mature and enterprise ready projects together with practical examples of how to use them.

==Regional Roadshows==
OWASP Regional Roadshows consist of one or more speakers visiting multiple chapters in a region (touring) either as speakers for chapter meetings or to provide training. These Roadshows help Chapter Leaders bring in great international speakers as well as generate awareness in their areas around Application Security and OWASP.
