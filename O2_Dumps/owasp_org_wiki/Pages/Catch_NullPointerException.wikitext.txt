==Description==

It is generally a bad practice to catch NullPointerException.

Programmers typically catch NullPointerException under three circumstances:

# The program contains a null pointer dereference. Catching the resulting exception was easier than fixing the underlying problem. 
# The program explicitly throws a NullPointerException to signal an error condition. 
# The code is part of a test harness that supplies unexpected input to the classes under test. 
Of these three circumstances, only the last is acceptable.

==Risk Factors==
TBD

==Examples ==

The following code mistakenly catches a NullPointerException.

<pre>
	  try {
		mysteryMethod();
	  }
	  catch (NullPointerException npe) {
	  }
</pre>
