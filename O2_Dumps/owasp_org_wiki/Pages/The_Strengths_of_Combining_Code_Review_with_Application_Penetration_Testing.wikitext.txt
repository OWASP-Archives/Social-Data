== The presentation  ==

[[Image:Owasp_logo_normal.jpg|right]]
This presentation describes the strengths and benefits of combining code analysis with application penetration testing during the assessment of the security of an application. It specifically covers the following:

* The strengths of manual code review in findings vulnerabilities (using the Top 10 as the categories)
* The strengths of manual pen testing in findings vulnerabilities (against Top 10)
* How each technique can leverage the other.
* How proving a vulnerability can really be exploited can be important, but not really in a mature organization
* The massive benefit of finding where the vulnerabilities are in the CODE, not just finding out how to exploit the application
* How tracking down a penetration testing finding to where the flaw is in the actual code can be EXTREMELY hard
