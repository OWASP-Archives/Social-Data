==== Main  ====

The Broken Web Applications Project (BWA) is an effort to provide
a wealth of applications with known vulnerabilities for those interested in:

*learning about web application security
*testing manual assessment techniques
*testing automated tools
*testing source code analysis tools
*observing web attacks
*testing WAFs and similar code technologies

all the while saving people interested in doing either learning or testing
the pain of having to compile, configure, and catalog all of the things
normally involved in doing this process from scratch.
