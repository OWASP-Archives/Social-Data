=====Projects Mailing List =====

*Jason Li populated the owasp-projects mailing list with all known projects leaders so the Projects Committee could easily send announcements regarding OWASP projects news. I have supported this activity by gathering all email addresses and filling in projects inventory spreadsheet. By GPC decision, the list is owasp-projects@lists.owasp.org and it is announce-only by the GPC committee members (similar to how OWASP-all is announce-only by Board/staff members) and should be reserved for project announcements only.

=====OWASP Newsletter =====
*I've prepared GPC's data for the next issue of the OWASP Newsletter.

=====Routine Tasks =====
*My daily routine always includes answering a relatively wide range of questions regularly posed by OWASP members and mainly by OWASP Projects leaders; I receive such inquiries either directly or through the [https://spreadsheets0.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhtB029bdcxGdFN1R2NIMTNROXN3dml4ZEcxXzJQYXc#gid=0 OWASP Website Global Feedback & Inquiry Form]. The variety of matters that I currently deal with can be checked in my email tool and the tree of folders built to store, follow up and organize them as follows [http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13817486/Screen%20Shots%20copy/1_Screen%20shot.png 1],[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13817486/Screen%20Shots%20copy/2_Screen%20shot.png 2],[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13817486/Screen%20Shots%20copy/3_Screen%20shot.png 3],[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13817486/Screen%20Shots%20copy/4_Screen%20shot.png 4],[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13817486/Screen%20Shots%20copy/5_Screen%20shot.png 5],[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13817486/Screen%20Shots%20copy/6_Screen%20shot.png 6],[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13817486/Screen%20Shots%20copy/7_Screen%20shot.png 7],[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13817486/Screen%20Shots%20copy/8_Screen%20shot.png 8],[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13817486/Screen%20Shots%20copy/9_Screen%20shot.png 9]. I would like to note that to perform this task, and all the others projects' related ones, I have always had relevant support and guidance from the OWASP Global Projects Committee.
*I've kept all [[OWASP Projects Dashboard 2.0]]'s databases up-to-date as follows:
** [[OWASP Reviews Dashboard]],
** [[OWASP Project Reviewers Database]],
** [[OWASP Projects Dashboard 2.0/By Set Up Order|Projects 2.0/By Set Up Date Order]],
** [[OWASP Projects Dashboard 2.0/By Alphabetical Order|Projects 2.0/By Alphabetic Order]],

**Carry out the Project Hosting initiative as a tool to provide a centralized repository for OWASP;
**Build a new OWASP Projects Portal;

*As soon as the above referred assessment's second leg is designed and approved, to begin a process to evaluate as much Projects as possible.
