==Legal==
Local Chapters operate independently from the [[OWASP Foundation]], and Local Chapter leaders are responsible for all aspects of their meetings. Local Chapters should use the official OWASP Portal ([[Main Page|www.owasp.org]]) and [http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo mailing lists] for communications, and should not use or display the OWASP logo on other websites. Commercial use of the OWASP name or logo is strictly prohibited.

===Charter===
Each Local Chapter agrees to the [http://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_OWASP#CODE_OF_ETHICS Code of Ethics and Principles] and adhere to the general concept of OWASP: to produce free and open unbiased tools and documentation promoting software and application security.  In 2009' each chapter will identify a min., of (3) indiviudals as chapter leaders to ensure volunteerism and sustainability and list them on the local chapter website page. Should a chapter "stall" ANY INDIVIDUAL is welcomed to review the [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Chapter_Leader_Handbook Chapter Guide] and then contact the [http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Contact OWASP Foundation] director of operations Kate Hartman to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteer volunteer]

==Sponsorship==
Annual and one-time meeting sponsorships of Local Chapters are allowed using the local chapter wiki page donate button. Local Chapter sponsors will be recognized on the Local Chapter homepage and in official meeting announcements. We encourage [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership#Categories_of_Membershipcorporate membership] to OWASP Foundation

===Sponsor Rules===
Presentations that focus on a problem or set of problems and discuss solution approaches that may refer to or show examples of various products are allowed. 

==Web Site==
Each Local Chapter will have a webpage on the OWASP Portal. Local Chapters may use the OWASP logo on this page and any associated pages. See the [[NYNJMetro|NY/NJ Metro]] chapter page for an example.

==Meetings==
Local Chapters are autonomous when it comes to meeting location, meeting logistics, and the choice of topics that are to be discussed.

===Meeting Announcements===
Meetings should be scheduled at least quarterly, and announced two weeks before their actual date. Local Chapters should update the [[OWASP Community]] page with meeting dates and times (this will be updated on the main page shortly thereafter).

===Meeting Minutes===
Each meeting held by a Local Chapter should be documented. This documentation is then posted on the OWASP website for the given chapter. This documentation should be in English.

==Mailing List==

===Mailing List Use===
The Chapter mailing list is intended to facilitate communication among local chapter members.  All communication must adhere to the OWASP Code of Ethics.  The mailing list is NOT to be used for recruiter job postings.

===Mailing List Moderation===
The Local Chapter may appoint a moderator for their mailing list. The moderator(s) need to ensure that the discussions stay on topic with a suitable tone of voice for an official OWASP mailing list. It is very important that all local chapter leaders/board members are on the mailing list with admin rights as this includes these persons in the OWASP-LEADERS global mailing lists for announcements.

===Mailing List Languages===
Consider urging your subscribers of the mailing list to accept posting in the local tongue as well as English. This way people not capable of the local tongue are able to read the archives of a local chapter.

==Privacy==
The privacy of chapter members and meeting attendees should be protected. Local Chapters should not disclose names, email addresses, or other identifying information about members. Only aggregate statistics can be referenced. If a meeting co-sponsor is utilized that organization might consider doing a raffle in exchange for business cards.
