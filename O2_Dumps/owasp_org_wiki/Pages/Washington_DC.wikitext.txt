'''Speaker''': Alissa Torres

'''Topic''': Application Footprinting

'''Abstract''': Application footprinting is a great skill for forensic examiners (and anyone interested in binary research) because it allows you to marry artifacts in the registry/file creation/time/date stamps with specific applications or user initiated events.  Eventually, during the course of an investigation, an examiner is going to run into a "new" problem - one that hasn't previously been experienced/researched by others in the field.  Application footprinting is a simple method that examines the interaction of a program with the operating system.  The process of footprinting will determine if the application was installed on the system being investigated, what trace evidence exists and how that can be mined.  This presentation will include a demo of Active Registry Monitor and its use in tracking changes made to the Windows Registry by an open source ssh client.

'''Bio''': Alissa Torres currently works as a security researcher for KEYW Corporation in Maryland and has 10 years technical expertise in the information technology field. Previously, she was a digital forensic investigator on a government contractor security team. She has extensive experience in information security, spanning government, academic and corporate environments and holds a Bachelor’s degree from University of Virginia and a Master’s from University of Maryland in Information Technology. Alissa taught as an instructor at the Defense Cyber Investigations Training Academy (DCITA), teaching incident response and network basics to security professionals entering the forensics community. In addition, she has presented at various industry conferences and currently holds the following industry certifications: GCFA, CISSP, EnCE.

<br><br>
::'''Abstract: Assessing your Assessment Practice''' - Years ago, organizations embraced Penetration Testing to find vulnerabilities in their applications. Later, vulnerabilities remained and many added a Source Code Review practice, often supported by commercial tooling. Others possess "Holistic Assessment" schemes which combine techniques in hopes of finding an even broader range of vulnerabilities their applications may possess.Years into what most consider maturation, organizations continue to let crippling vulnerability into production despite costly assessment. What's going on?

::In this presentation, we'll consider assessment practices of various shapes and sizes focusing on particularly interesting Fortune 100 companies (assessing 300-1000 apps / year) as well as the single-man-shop. We'll discuss assessment coverage (code and vulnerability), cost, and measures of remediation.

::Next, we'll discuss what methodological, tool-based, measurement, and other techniques can dramatically improve cost, coverage, or successful remediation in your assessment practice.
<br><br>
:'''Krystal Moon'''

:: Krystal Moon is a Cyber Security Analyst at SRA International, Inc. She currently supports the Department of Homeland Security Software Assurance Program where one of her tasks is co-authoring the Secure Coding Pocket Guide. Previously, she provided certification and accreditation support for various government agencies.

SwA Pocket Guides are developed collaboratively by the SwA Forum and Working Groups, which function as a stakeholder community that welcomes additional participation in advancing and refining software security. The Pocket Guides are offered as informative use only and a good starting point for the relevant practices.
 
:::'''Secure Coding'''
:::Secure coding is a prerequisite for producing robustly secure software. The development of secure software is a complex endeavor and requires a systematic process. The most commonly exploited vulnerabilities are seemingly easily avoided defects in software. Producing secure code is not an absolute science because it depends on a wide range of variables, some of which cannot be easily or accurately measured. Such variables range from the language or platform being used to the nature of the software being developed or the data with which the software is meant to work. This guide does not prescribe answers for all possible situations. Rather, it discusses fundamental practices for secure coding, and lists resources that provide more information about these practices. Using these resources, practitioners can write more secure code for their particular environment.
 
:::'''Architecture and Design Considerations for Secure Software'''
:::The Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) defines the design phase as both "the process of defining the architecture, components, interfaces, and other characteristics of a system or component" and "the result of [that] process." The software design phase is the software engineering life cycle activity where software requirements are analyzed in order to produce a description of the software’s internal structure that will serve as the basis for its implementation. The software design phase consists of the architectural design and detailed design activities. These activities follow software requirements analysis phase and precedes the software implementation the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This volume of the pocket guide compiles architecture and design software techniques for security and offers guidance on when they should be employed during the SDLC.

Jack also serves as a board member for the OWASP Northern Virginia chapter.

:'''Abstract'''

::'''Building Secure Android Applications''' - Mobile platforms are gaining momentum as an attacker's favorite new playground. We are seeing huge increases in mobile malware, mobile exploits, and the ever common insecure mobile applications themselves. Mature development shops and startups alike are releasing new applications at the speed of light. Like many other rapidly booming markets, technical innovation is far outpacing the adoption of security best-practices. This is a problem we must solve sooner than later.

::This presentation will highlight many of the new security and privacy challenges developers, organizations, and consumers must be aware of. Android will be our target of interest during this presentation. A threat model for the Android platform will be presented, identifying the various layers where risks are introduced. We will discuss the top mobile security risks and the security controls used to mitigate them using guidance provided by the OWASP Mobile Security Project.

::Expect a ton of code samples and live remediation of vulnerabilities. The OWASP GoatDroid project will be used to demonstrate various Android application security flaws. GoatDroid is a fully featured training environment for exploring the attack surface of Android apps. It is highly extendable, and includes several robust RESTful web services.

::At the end of this presentation, attendees will understand how to identify Android risks, how to build secure applications for the Android platform, and will be exposed to the current initiatives within the Mobile Security Project.

* Jeff Ennis from Veracode will be presenting on Application Risk Management
* Dan Philpott will be briefing on the upcoming NIST SP covering Web Application Security
* Chuck Willis will be giving an update on the OWASP BWA project and releasing and update to BWA
* Doug Wilson will update on plans for future meetings and upcoming events.

'''About our Speakers'''

'''Jeff Ennis'''

:Jeff Ennis is a Solutions Architect for Veracode, Inc.  He has more than 20 years experience in information technology.  He recently served as Security Solutions Manager for the Federal Division of IBM Internet Security Systems, where he and his team of security architects assisted DoD, Civilian, and Intel agencies with addressing their security requirements as  they dealt with an ever-changing threat landscape..   Throughout his career he has represented both the end user and vendor communities, including Nortel Networks, UUNET, and Lockheed Martin. 

:'''Abstract'''

:'''Application Risk Management''' - Application vulnerabilities are steeply on the rise. At $350 billion per year software is the largest manufacturing industry in the world yet there are no uniform standards or insight into security, risk or liability of the final product.  The development environment is becoming increasingly complex – application origin ranges from internally developed code, outsourced, 3rd party, Open Source, and Commercial Off the Shelf software.  Ensuring that these entities are creating secure software is becoming a daunting task.  Lots of emphasis is placed on IT controls, patching, etc, but the new attack vector is your application.  During this presentation we will recap the state of software security today, discuss some initiatives which are requiring application risk management, and provide suggestions on how you can begin managing the application risk at your organization.

'''Dan Philpott'''

:Dan is the maintainer of fismapedia.org, and a recognized expert in IT standards and policy in the DC Metro Area. Dan routinely helps review and contribute to NIST SP and Report documents.

Any and all who are interested in this process or contributing to government security policy are welcome to stick around and observe or contribute.

'''September 2009 Meeting'''

* The meeting was held at [http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/4344425/ September 2nd at 6:30 PM, at Duques Hall (Room 553D) on the GWU campus in Washington DC]
* Matthew Flick and Jeff Yestrumskas will give an encore of their talk on the Cross-Site Scripting Anonymous Browsers (XAB) that they have previously presented at Black Hat and at Defcon.
* Doug Wilson talking about the recent launch of the AppSec DC 2009 website, and what's going on with the conference.


'''XAB -- The Abstract:'''

Earlier this year, the Cross-site Scripting Anonymous Browser (“XAB”) was presented at Black Hat DC as a new perspective on how we could extend the functionality of browser technologies, form dynamic botnets for browsing, and create an unpronounceable acronym all at once. We continued the madness with a second incarnation of the XAB framework at Defcon in August.

XAB hasn't really revolutionized attacks or defenses in it's short lifespan, nor is it great at factoring primes. However, it has opened minds by demonstrating an interesting way to combine unlike ideas and creating a new animal all of it's own. Think of it as forced social networking, without ever really knowing who you're talking to, or what they're saying.

During this presentation, we will explain the origins of the concept, provide a brief review of the technologies, pour over the trials and tribulations of the enhancements and additions of the past 6 months, provide a live demonstration of the improvements, and continue the conversation about the future of the framework.

= History =

The original DC Chapter was founded in June 2004 by [mailto:jeff.williams(at)owasp.org Jeff Williams] and has had members from Virginia to Delaware.

In April 2005 a new chapter, DC-Virginia, was formed and the DC Chapter was renamed to DC-Maryland.

In 2008, the DC-Maryland chapter was given over to the stewardship of co-chairs Rex Booth, Mark Bristow, and Doug Wilson, and charged by the OWASP board to create a chapter focused on the needs of Washington DC in specific. The new chapter has tried to reach out to government and academic environments found in DC as well as the private sector.

The DC chapter will be hosting OWASP AppSec DC in November of 2009, the national OWASP conference for the year.
