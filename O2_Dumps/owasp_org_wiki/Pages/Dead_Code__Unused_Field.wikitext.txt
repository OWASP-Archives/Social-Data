* Discuss the technical impact of a successful exploit of this vulnerability
* Consider the likely [business impacts] of a successful attack


==Examples==

===Example 1===

The field named glue is not used in the following class. The author of the class has accidentally put quotes around the field name, transforming it into a string constant.

<pre>
	public class Dead {
	
	  String glue;
	
	  public String getGlue() {
		return "glue";
	  }
	
	}
</pre>

===Example 2===

The field named glue is used in the following class, but only from a method that is never called.

<pre>
	public class Dead {
	
	  String glue;
	
	  private String getGlue() {
		return glue;
	  }
	
	}
</pre>
