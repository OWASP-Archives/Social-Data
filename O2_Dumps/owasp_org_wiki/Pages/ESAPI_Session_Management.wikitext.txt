== Feature Overview (in Version 2.0)==

* Be able to distinguish initial login and subsequent login after session timeout (working)

* To Change session ID after a successful login with optional session content replication so that a timed out user can continue where he/she has left off (working)
  
* Safe session management functions that will reject invalid session requests. For example, a request for session contents on an expired session should be rejected until the session is reactivated.

* Automatic CSRF token validation in a centralized location. 

* A collection of anti-CSRF tags that can automatically incorporate CSRF token in forms when used in JSP pages 


TODO

== Possible Enhancements == 

* Add a secure form tag that does CSRF as well as other form protections like autocomplete

* Separate session management API and CSRF from the Authentication and HTTP utilities

* Add a flag to the changeSessionIdentifier method to not copy session content

* Consider whether ESAPI can provide CSRF protection without the User object - can we break the dependency
