1. At what extent have the project deliveries & objectives been accomplished?  Having in consideration [[OWASP Summer of Code 2008 Applications#OWASP Code review guide, V1.1|'''the assumed ones''']], please exemplify writing down those of them that haven't been realised.
 | colspan="2" style="width:75%; background:#cccccc" align="left"|I evaluated the guide from the following perspectives:
<br>1) OWASP writing style: The guide has 100% followed the guidelines specified in OWASP for writing guides. I believe. The language is lucid and easy to understand. The layout of the book proceeds in a logical manner. There are some spelling issues but those are quite minor.
<br>2) Beta Quality and further: The Beta quality has been thoroughly reached and the guide as an overall package satisfies all criteria for the same. Its also available as a download from the bookstore and has a TOC. There are links to other OWASP Tools and Documentation Projects as and where applicable.
<br>3) Technical Suggestions: From a developer's perspective the examples section for XSS and SQL Injection could probably do with a few more sample codes on how the vulnerabilities can be exploited. Also if the guide could expand on dealing with SDLC vis-a-vis code review for security, it might be more helpful.
<br>4) Objectives Achieved: Even though this is a 50% review and the above points notwithstanding, the guide has been ''par excellence'' in achieving its objectives.
