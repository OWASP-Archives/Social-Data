==Overview==

'''Development work on version 3 never got much past the concept stage as there was significant work to do to stabilize the previous versions and correct some problems. ''' 
The J2EE platform does not include any validation features. This leaves many organizations to craft their own validation mechanisms, often incomplete, flawed, and inefficient.

The 3.x series will mark the inclusion of web application firewall specific features. OWASP Stinger 3.x will have some of the following notable features:

:* Validation of the entire HTTP request: including URI, headers, cookies, and parameters
:* A robust "learning" mode to make rule generation simplistic and efficient.
:* A full web application dedicated to editing the OWASP Stinger configuration files

Check out the full list of new features being implemented at the [http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Stinger_3_Ideas OWASP Stinger 3.x ideas page].
