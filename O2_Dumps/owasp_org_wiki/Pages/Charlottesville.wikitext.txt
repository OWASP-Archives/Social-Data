'''TOPIC''': "Cross-Site Scripting Anonymous Browsers"<BR>
'''SPEAKER''': Matthew Flick, Principal FYRM Associates<BR>
'''DESCRIPTION''': Matthew Flick will give an encore of his talk on the Cross-Site Scripting Anonymous Browsers (XAB) that he has previously presented at Black Hat and at Defcon. Time permitting, we will then move to the lab in room 136 to do hands on Cross-Site Scripting exercises.<BR><BR>

'''XAB - The Abstract''':<BR>
Earlier this year, the Cross-site Scripting Anonymous Browser (“XAB”) was presented at Black Hat DC as a new perspective on how we could extend the functionality of browser technologies, form dynamic botnets for browsing, and create an unpronounceable acronym all at once. We continued the madness with a second incarnation of the XAB framework at Defcon in August.<BR>

XAB hasn't really revolutionized attacks or defenses in it's short lifespan, nor is it great at factoring primes. However, it has opened minds by demonstrating an interesting way to combine unlike ideas and creating a new animal all of it's own. Think of it as forced social networking, without ever really knowing who you're talking to, or what they're saying.<BR>

During this presentation, we will explain the origins of the concept, provide a brief review of the technologies, pour over the trials and tribulations of the enhancements and additions of the past 6 months, provide a live demonstration of the improvements, and continue the conversation about the future of the framework.<BR><BR>
