Many forensics investigations lead to the discovery that a SQL Server database might have been breached. If investigators cannot assess and qualify the scope of an intrusion, they may be forced to report it publicly – a disclosure that is painful for companies and customers alike.

We’ll also review techniques that can be used to qualify the actions that were performed by an unauthorized database user.
