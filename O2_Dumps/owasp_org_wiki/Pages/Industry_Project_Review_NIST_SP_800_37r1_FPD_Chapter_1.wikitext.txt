THE NEED FOR MANAGING [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System-related_Security_Risks INFORMATION SYSTEM-RELATED SECURITY RISKS]


Organizations<ref>The term organization is used in this publication to describe an [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Entity entity] of any size, complexity, or positioning within an organizational structure (e.g., a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Federal_Agency federal agency] or, as appropriate, any of its operational elements).</ref> depend on information technology and the information systems<ref>An information system is a discrete set of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_Resources information resources] organized for the collection, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Processing processing], [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Maintenance maintenance], use, sharing, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Dissemination dissemination], or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Disposition disposition] of information.</ref> that are developed from that technology to successfully carry out their missions and business functions. Information systems can include a range of diverse computing platforms from high-end supercomputers to personal digital assistants and cellular telephones. Information systems can also include very specialized systems and devices (e.g., [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Telecommunications_Systems telecommunications systems], industrial/process control systems, testing and calibration devices, weapons systems, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Command_and_Control command and control] systems, and environmental control systems). Federal information systems<ref>A [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Federal_Information_System federal information system] is defined as an information system used or operated by a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Federal_Agency federal agency], or by a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Contractor contractor] of a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Federal_Agency federal agency] or by another organization on behalf of a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Federal_Agency federal agency].</ref> are subject to serious ''threats'' that can have adverse impacts<ref>Adverse impacts to the Nation include, for example, compromises to information systems that support critical infrastructure applications or are paramount to government continuity of operations as defined by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Department_of_Homeland_Security Department of Homeland Security].</ref> on organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation by compromising the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information being processed, stored, or transmitted by those systems. Threats to information systems include environmental disruptions, human or machine errors, and purposeful attacks. Cyber attacks on information systems today are often aggressive, disciplined, well-organized, well-funded, and in a growing number of documented cases, very sophisticated. Successful attacks on public and private sector information systems can result in great harm to the national and economic security interests of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:United_States United States]. Given the significant and growing danger of these threats, it is imperative that leaders at all levels understand their responsibilities for achieving adequate information security<ref>OMB [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:Circular_A-130 Circular A-130], Appendix III, describes [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Adequate_Security adequate security] as security commensurate with risk. This risk includes both the likelihood and magnitude of harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Unauthorized_Access unauthorized access] to or modification of information.</ref> and for managing [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System-related_Security_Risks information system-related security risks].<ref>Risk is a measure of the extent to which an [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Entity entity] is threatened by a potential circumstance or event, and is typically a function of the likelihood of the circumstance or event occurring and of the resulting adverse impacts.</ref>


== 1.1 BACKGROUND ==

NIST in partnership with the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Department_of_Defense Department of Defense] ([http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:DOD DOD]), the Office of the Director of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:National_Intelligence National Intelligence] ([http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:ODNI ODNI]), and the Committee on [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:National_Security_Systems National Security Systems] ([http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:CNSS CNSS]), is developing a common information security framework for the federal government and its support contractors. This publication represents the second in a series of publications developed by the Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative. The initial publication produced by the joint task force, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:NIST_Special_Publication_800-53 NIST Special Publication 800-53], Revision 3, created a unified security control catalog reflecting the information [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Requirements security requirements] of both the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:National_Security national security] community and the nonnational security community. [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:NIST_Special_Publication_800-37 NIST Special Publication 800-37], Revision 1, continues the evolution to a unified framework by transforming the traditional [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Certification_and_Accreditation Certification and Accreditation] (C&A) process into the six-step [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management Risk Management] Framework ([http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:RMF RMF]). The revised process emphasizes: (i) building information security capabilities into federal information systems through the application of state-of-the-practice management, operational, and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Technical_Security technical security] controls; (ii) maintaining awareness of the security state of information systems on an ongoing basis though enhanced monitoring processes; and (iii) providing essential information to senior leaders to facilitate credible decisions regarding the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Acceptance acceptance] of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation arising from the operation and use of information systems.

The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:RMF RMF]-based process has the following characteristics:

*   Promotes the concept of near [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Real-Time real-time] [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] and ongoing information system authorization through the implementation of robust continuous monitoring processes;
*   Encourages the use of automation and automated support tools to provide senior leaders the necessary information to take credible, risk-based decisions with regard to the organizational information systems supporting their core missions and business functions;
*   Integrates information security more closely into the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Enterprise_Architecture enterprise architecture] and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Development_Life_Cycle system development life cycle];
*   Provides equal emphasis on the selection, implementation, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment], and monitoring of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls], and the authorization of information systems;
*   Links [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] processes at the information [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Level system level] to [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] processes at the organization level through a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)]; and
*   Establishes responsibility and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Accountability accountability] for [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] deployed within organizational information systems and inherited by those systems (i.e., common controls).

The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] process described in this publication and in other supporting NIST publications changes the traditional focus from the stove-pipe, organization-centric, static-based approaches to C&A and provides the capability to more effectively manage [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System-related_Security_Risks information system-related security risks] in highly dynamic environments of complex and sophisticated cyber threats, ever increasing system vulnerabilities, and rapidly changing missions.


== 1.2 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY ==

The purpose of this publication is to provide guidelines for applying the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management Risk Management] Framework to federal information systems to include conducting the activities of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Categorization security categorization],<ref>Security categorization methodologies are described in [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:CNSS_Instruction_1253 CNSS Instruction 1253] for [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:National_Security_Systems national security systems] and in [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:FIPS_199 FIPS 199] for other than [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:National_Security_Systems national security systems].</ref> security control selection and implementation, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Control_Assessment security control assessment], information system authorization,<ref>Security authorization is the official management decision given by a senior organizational official to authorize operation of an information system and to explicitly accept the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls].</ref> and security control monitoring. The guidelines have been developed:

*   To ensure that managing risk from the operation and use of federal information systems is consistent with the organization's mission/business objectives and overall risk strategy established by the senior leadership through the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)];
*   To ensure that information [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Requirements security requirements], including necessary [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls], are integrated into the organization's [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Enterprise_Architecture enterprise architecture] and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Development_Life_Cycle system development life cycle] processes;
*   To support consistent, well-informed, and ongoing [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] decisions (through continuous monitoring), transparency of security and risk-related information, and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Reciprocity reciprocity] of authorization results;<ref>Reciprocity of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] results is the mutual agreement among participating organizations to accept each other's security assessments in order to reuse information system resources and/or to accept each other's assessed security posture in order to share information. [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Reciprocity Reciprocity] is best achieved by promoting the concept of transparency (i.e., making sufficient evidence regarding the security state of an information system available, so that an [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] from another organization can use that evidence to make credible, risk-based decisions regarding the operation and use of that system or the information it processes, stores, or transmits).</ref> and
*   To achieve more secure information and information systems within the federal government through the implementation of appropriate [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Mitigation risk mitigation] strategies.

This publication satisfies the requirements of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:Federal_Information_Security_Management Act|Federal Information Security Management Act] (FISMA) and meets or exceeds the information [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Requirements security requirements] established for executive agencies<ref>An [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Executive_Agency executive agency] is: (i) an executive department specified in [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:5_U.S.C.,_Section_101 5 U.S.C., Section 101]; (ii) a military department specified in [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:5_U.S.C.,_Section_102 5 U.S.C., Section 102]; (iii) an independent establishment as defined in [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:5_U.S.C.,_Section_104(1) 5 U.S.C., Section 104(1)]; and ([http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:IV iv]) a wholly owned government [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Corporation corporation] fully subject to the provisions of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:31_U.S.C.,_Chapter_91 31 U.S.C., Chapter 91]. In this publication, the term [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Executive_Agency executive agency] is synonymous with the term [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Federal_Agency federal agency].</ref> by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Office_of_Management_and_Budget Office of Management and Budget] (OMB) in [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:Circular_A-130 Circular A-130], Appendix III, ''Security of Federal Automated Information Resources''. The guidelines in this publication are applicable to all federal information systems<ref>A [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Federal_Information_System federal information system] is an information system used or operated by an [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Executive_Agency executive agency], by a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Contractor contractor] of an [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Executive_Agency executive agency], or by another organization on behalf of an [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Executive_Agency executive agency].</ref> other than those systems designated as [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:National_Security_Systems national security systems] as defined in [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:44_U.S.C.,_Section_3542 44 U.S.C., Section 3542]. The guidelines have been broadly developed from a technical perspective to complement similar guidelines for [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:National_Security_Systems national security systems] and may be used for such systems with the approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy authority over such systems. State, local, and tribal governments, as well as private sector organizations are encouraged to consider using these guidelines, as appropriate.<ref>Interconnection of federal information systems with information systems operated by state, local, and/or tribal governments requires the application of the information security standards and guidelines described in this publication. Information [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Requirements security requirements] and the terms and conditions of the system interconnections, are expressed in the Memorandums of Understanding and Interconnection Security Agreements established by participating organizations.</ref>
