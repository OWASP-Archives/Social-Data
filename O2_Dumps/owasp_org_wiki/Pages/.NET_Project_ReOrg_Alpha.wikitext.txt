'''Purpose'''

The purpose of the OWASP .NET Project is to provide a central repository of information and tools for software professionals that use the Microsoft .NET Framework for web applications and services.  The project will try to include resources from Microsoft and from the Open Source community, the Alt.NET community and other related security resources.

Please review the [[:Category:Vulnerability|vulnerabilities]] section at OWASP for the grand list of web vulnerabilities, many apply to .NET software.  This section has a Quick Reference table for OWASP projects that you can use for your security projects now.  For .NET related content throughout the site, look for the [[:Category:.NET|.NET category]].  There is plenty of work to be done, so feel free to join the OWASP .NET Project (See Joining the project below).  Contribute work or join our mailing list, many voices are better than one, so join today!

'''Goals'''

*To provide a comprehensive collection of resources for all roles involved with designing, developing and maintaining .NET web applications and services.

*To organize content specific to OWASP projects that can be used or referenced for .NET security.

*To reach out and bring in content from the open source community to protect users of .NET web applications and services.
