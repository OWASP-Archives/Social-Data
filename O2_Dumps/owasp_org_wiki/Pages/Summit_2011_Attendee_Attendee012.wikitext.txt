| summit_attendee_bio= Sebastien Deleersnyder (Seba), Managing Technical Consultant SAIT Zenitel. Starting up the ICT Security bussines line for SAIT Zenitel BeNeLux-France (www.saitzenitel.com). I started the Belgian OWASP Chapter in 2005, have started the OWASP Education project and participate in the global chapters committee and the Board of the OWASP Foundation. I co-organize the yearly security & hacker BruCON conference and trainings in Brussels (www.brucon.org). As security project leader and information security officer for multiple customers I have build up extensive experience in Information Security related disciplines, both at strategic and tactical level. I specialise in (Web) Application Security, combining both my broad development and information security experience.
