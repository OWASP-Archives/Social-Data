Since twitter is such a "movement" perhaps we can drive a SUMMIT KICK OFF TWEET  

Another thought is to have out of the office messages around the world drive people to the live streams of the even.  You have 100+ persons at the summit that is ALOT OF EMAILS going back to people as out of the office messages if we can get people to buy into the concept

Edit the below and add your suggestions for out of the office messages:<br>
