The unexpected matters. Right now, there‘s something in the air, something really big. It‘s so big that to many it‘s hidden in plain sight. We are witnessing a seismic shift in information technology, the kind that comes around every decade or so, and it will have a huge impact on business, especially in today‘s volatile economy and world of exponential change. It‘s called „the Cloud“ a 21st century business platform built on cloud computing technologies. In this keynote, Peter takes us on a fascinating journey to explore what the Cloud portends for business. In the past, IT was about productivity; now in the Cloud it‘s about collaboration, a shared information base, and collective intelligence. The „wow“ isn‘t about on-demand IT, it‘s about on-demand business innovation. Buckle up and get ready to win in this brave new world. You don‘t want to miss Peter‘s fast-paced and insightful talk.
