| Course_Overview_Goal 
=&nbsp;
*Apart from OWASP's Top 10, most [[:Category:OWASP_Project|OWASP Projects]] are not widely used and understood. In most cases this is not due to lack of quality and usefulness of those Document & Tool projects, but due to a lack of understanding of where they fit in an Enterprise's security ecosystem or in the Web Application Development Life-cycle.

*This course aims to change that by providing a selection of mature and enterprise ready projects together with practical examples of how to use them.

*If you are interested in participating in the hands on portion of the course, please bring a laptop.

*All OWASP Training Material can be downloaded from [http://code.google.com/p/owasp-training/downloads/list here].

==== OWASP Internals ====
===== Training Concept =====

We are proposing a Chapters driven model with local Chapter organization in which the courses are free for OWASP members, the contents are OWASP projects focused and the costs are supported by a mix of funding i.e. local chapter budget, external sponsorship, trainers sponsorship i.e. trip and/or accommodation paid by themselves and local chapter members’ sponsorship i.e. taking trainers in as guests.

===== Training Methodologies =====
* Course Evaluation Form - [http://www.owasp.org/images/6/60/2_Course_Evaluation_Form_%282%29.pdf PDF] and [http://www.owasp.org/images/c/ca/2_Course_Evaluation_Form.doc Word] Files

===== Sponsorship Opportunities =====
*[http://docs.google.com/View?id=dcn8962c_77jvz3s2c2 OWASP Training Sponsorship - UK/Draft still under work]

===== London Training Specifics =====
*[https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0An4Puwz7EA41dGhjRXBOaVdzWjkzckdxM2IxdDhjZ0E&hl=en OWASP London Training Course’s Financials] 
*[http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tVo97PmDAcUdwF6rjv0tfvA&output=html London Training's Logistics&Costs]
