To ensure that this project leads to continuing improvement in the security of OWASP projects, we need more OWASP project leaders to incorporate static analysis into their project's software development lifecycle.  We have received only one volunteer who was willing to take the time to incorporate static analysis into his project: Yiannis, project leader of the JBroFuzz project.  We can analyze OWASP projects on our own, but it's important to include static analysis as part of the lifecycle.
