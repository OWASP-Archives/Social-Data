The current status of tasks planned for the end of June is:
#Team finalized (100%)
#Projects selected (100%)
#Preliminary workflow (100%)
#Projects submitted (0%)
Since the Fortify open source review is not currently accepting projects, we have not been able to submit any projects.  However, we are currently analyzing the following tools using Fortify's commercial source code analyzer (SCA) tool.  
#MediaWiki
#SquirrelMail
#WordPress
The updated version of Fortify's web site will allow us to upload the FPR files generated by this tool to create projects immediately, instead of waiting a week.  The following tasks remain to be done:
#Revise workflow based on reviews.
#Submit initial project to Fortify site once its online for testing.
#Submit 3 projects as continuously analyzed projects on Fortify site.
#Select additional OWASP and non-OWASP projects to analyze.
