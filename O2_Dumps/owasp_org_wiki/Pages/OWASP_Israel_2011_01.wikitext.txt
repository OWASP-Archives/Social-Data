'''Avi Douglen''' 

Based on the same engine as the very popular StackOverflow.com ... [http://Security.StackExchange.com Security.StackExchange.com] is a fantastic knowledge resource for all things security, privacy, risk, etc - both technical and not. In this short presentation Avi will present the forum and how it can help us. 

== 19:00 - 19:30&nbsp;: Universal HTTP Denial of Service  ==

'''Raviv Raz, Hybrid Security''' 

Denial of service attacks against web applications have recently caught much of the media attention featuring WikiLeaks, the RIAA, Amazon, PayPal, Bank of America, MasterCard and Visa as high-profile victims. DoS is the means of modern guerrilla warfare waged by political protesters to cyber extortionists. The SlowLoris and R-U-Dead-Yet attack tools have brought firewall-evasive techniques, capable of crashing cross-platform web servers and applications, into the hands of anybody with a broadband Internet connection. As inherent flaws within the HTTP protocol, these attacks cannot be mitigated by traditional IPS/Firewall/WAF/Load Balancer/Reverse Proxy solutions. We will chat about anatomy, exploitability and future research of layer-7 Denial-of-Service attacks.
