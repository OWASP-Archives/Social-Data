'''HECTOR, our evolving security intelligence platform'''<br>
'''Presenter:''' Justin Klein Keane

'''Abstract:'''

Asset management is an ever present challenge for any IT organization,
and especially so for information security groups.  Even more
challenging is data aggregation for intelligent security analysis (or
security intelligence).  HECTOR is an effort by the University of
Pennsylvania's School of Arts and Sciences to provide such a security
intelligence platform.  Organizing assets, scanning for vulnerabilities
and profiles, correlating attacks on your network to services offered by
hosts, tracking changes, following remediation, and making information
available to multiple users via a web interface are all goals of HECTOR.
HECTOR leverages honeypot technology, darknet sensors, port scans,
vulnerability scans, intrusion detection systems, the powerful open
source MySQL database, and a PHP based web front end to provide security
intelligence to security practitioners.  

HECTOR is an evolving, open source effort that attempts to leverage a wide variety of tools and
information sources to empower security practitioners with better
insights as well as to track and trend security related data.  Come hear
about HECTOR in advance the official open source launch at the Educause
Security Professionals 2012 conference.  Presentation material will
include a discussion of the philosophy behind HECTOR, the open source
technologies that make HECTOR work, as well as design challenges and
solutions.  Even if you don't end up using HECTOR the presentation seeks
to spur new ideas and ways of thinking about asset management and
security data.

'' The Search for Intelligent Life''

'''Synopsis:''' For years organizations have been mining and culling data warehouses to measure every layer of their business right down to the clickstream information of their web sites. These business intelligence tools have helped organizations identify points of poor product performance, highlighting areas of current and potential future demand, key performance indicators, etc. In the information security field we still tend to look at our information in silos. Dedicated engineers solely focused on web application security, network security, compliance and so on, all while bemoaning a lack of information and decision support.

In this talk, Ed will cover some of the many sources of security data publicly available and how to apply them to add context to your security data and tools to help make more intelligent decisions. Ed also points out a number of ways to repurpose information and tools your company is already using in order to glean a clearer view into your security and the threats that may effect it.

'''Bio:''' Ed Bellis is the CEO of HoneyApps Inc, a vulnerability management Software as a Service that centralizes, correlates, prioritizes and automates the entire stack of security vulnerabilities and remediation workflow. Prior to HoneyApps, Ed served as the Chief Information Security Officer for Orbitz, the well known online travel agency where he built and led the information security program and personnel for over 6 years. Ed has over 18 years experience in information security and technology. 
He is a frequent speaker at information security events across North America and Europe.

'''Mobile App Security Techniques'''

Look left, look right, look in your pocket, you probably glanced over a cellular phone. These devices are getting more and more pervasive in today's society. More importantly they are getting very powerful. This new market of software users have been the catalyst of the "app" boom. Everyone is jumping on board and developing mobile applications. This influx of mobile application development means there are a large number of mobile applications that get rushed to the market before they can be properly reviewed from a security standpoint. So guess what, more bugs for the taking!

In this talk we will lay out a few basic techniques that we use when we perform mobile application assessments, highlight possible pit falls that one should be aware and hopefully give those up and coming mobile application penetration testers a leg up on the competition.

'''Raj Umadas''' is a Consultant with the Intrepidus Group. Mr. Umadas graduated Summa Cum-Laude from The Polytechnic Institute of NYU with a BS in Computer Engineering. At NYU:Poly, Mr. Umadas pursued a highly expansive computer security curriculum. He is just as comfortable sniffing out a memory corruption bug as he is assessing the risk management decisions of large projects.

Coupled with Mr. Umadas' fresh academic outlook on security, he obtained a no-nonsense business sense of security while working in an Information Risk Management arm of a large investment bank. Corporate governance, segregation of duties, and SOX compliance were all daily concerns for Mr. Umadas.

Mr. Umadas is eager to establish his own niche in the security world where he will be the catalyst of some very major innovation. With his strong academics, proven real world experience, and never-say-no attitude; it is only a matter of time.

'''User Interface and Security in Web Applications'''

Security is often seen as a competing priority to good user experience, but the two are not diametrically opposed. Good user experience is essential to good security. Without ease of use, most people simply ignore or bypass security protections in systems. In order to craft effective security measures it is essential to take user experience into consideration. With the meteoric growth of web applications as a medium for service delivery it is critical to deploy good security measures. Web applications offer an always on, globally available target for attackers. Users need to be allies in the drive for application security, but far too often security measures are presented as onerous, time consuming, bothersome add-on's to web applications rather than seamlessly integrated, easy to use, user friendly features. In this talk I propose to explore some of the reasons why good security in web applications matters and how you can make security effective by making it easy to use.

'''Discovering PHP Vulnerabilities Via Code Auditing'''

Abstract: PHP provides an accessible, easy to use platform for developing dynamic
web applications.  As the number of web based applications grow, so too
does the threat from external attackers.  The open and global nature of
the web means that web applications are exposed to attack from around
the world around the clock.  Automated web application vulnerability
scanning technology is still very much in its infancy, and unable to
identify complex vulnerabilities that could lead to complete server
compromise.  While intrusion detection systems prove very valuable in
detecting attacks, the best way to prevent vulnerabilities is to engage
in active code review.  There are many advantages of direct code review
over automated testing, from the ability to identify complex edge
scenario vulnerabilities to finding non-exploitable flaws and fixing
them proactively.  Many vulnerabilities in PHP based web applications
are introduced with common misuse of the language or misunderstanding of
how functions can be safely utilized.  By understanding the common ways
in which vulnerabilities are introduced into PHP code it becomes easy to
quickly and accurately review PHP code and identify problems.  In
addition to common problems, PHP includes some obscure functionality
that can lead developers to unwittingly introduce vulnerabilities into
their applications.  By understanding the security implications of some
common PHP functions, code reviewers can pinpoint the use of such
functions in code and inspect them to ensure safety.
