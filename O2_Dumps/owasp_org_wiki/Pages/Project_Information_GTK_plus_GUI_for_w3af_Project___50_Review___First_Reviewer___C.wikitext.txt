Facundo has been working hard on the [[OWASP Summer of Code 2008 Applications - Need Futher Clarifications#GTK+ GUI for w3af project|'''previously specified tasks''']]. After a carefull examination, I can say that he is on schedule, mostly because he has chosen to solve the hardest tasks earlier and his excellent programming skills. A detailed progress can be seen in the [http://sourceforge.net/pm/task.php?group_id=170274&set=custom&group_project_id=56282&_assigned_to=0&_status=100&SUBMIT=Browse   w3af sourceforge project page].

The tasks that have been finished by him in this first phase are:

- '''#(Sourceforge task number)        (Description)'''

- #148110	Manually send a request and analyze the response

- #148111	Manually create a fuzzed requests based on tokens

- #148113	Embebed tool to encode/decode URL/Base64 and to hash sha1/md5

- #148224	Resend request

- #148114	HTTP response side by side content compare


He has also fixed some bugs that the w3af users found on the code he was working at, which is great for us.


The things that he still needs to work at are:

- '''#(Sourceforge task number)        (Description)'''

- #148109	Local proxy to trap and modify requests and responses

- #148112	Reload a plugin after its edited from within the GUI

- Meetings with a usability expert that the w3af team leader has already contacted and worked with.

- Wizard to perform a vulnerability assessment.

- Graphical display of site map and vulnerabilities. 

- Kill all pending bugs and make a stable release.

- Users guide for the pyGTK user interface.

- Help system for the GUI itself
