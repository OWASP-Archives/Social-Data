==Description==

If no mechanism is in place for managing password aging, users will have no incentive to update passwords in a timely manner.

'''Consequences'''

* Authentication: As passwords age, the probability that they are compromised grows.

'''Exposure period'''

* Design: Support for password aging mechanisms must be added in the design phase of development.

'''Platform'''

* Languages: All
* Operating platforms: All

'''Required resources'''

Any

'''Severity'''

Medium

'''Likelihood of exploit'''

Very Low

The recommendation that users change their passwords regularly and do not reuse passwords is universal among security experts. In order to enforce this, it is useful to have a mechanism that notifies users when passwords are considered old and that requests that they replace them with new, strong passwords. 

In order for this functionality to be useful, however, it must be accompanied with documentation which stresses how important this practice is and which makes the entire process as simple as possible for the user.


==Risk Factors==

* Talk about the [[OWASP Risk Rating Methodology|factors]] that make this vulnerability likely or unlikely to actually happen
* Discuss the technical impact of a successful exploit of this vulnerability
* Consider the likely [business impacts] of a successful attack


==Examples==

* A common example is not having a system to terminate old employee accounts.
* Not having a system for enforcing the changing of passwords every certain period.

==Related [[Attacks]]==

* [[Attack 1]]

==Related [[Vulnerabilities]]==

* [[Using password systems]]
* [[Allowing password aging]]
* [[Using a key past its expiration date]]


==Related [[Controls]]==

* Design: Ensure that password aging functionality is added to the design of the system, including an alert previous to the time the password is considered obsolete, and useful information for the user concerning the importance of password renewal, and the method.
