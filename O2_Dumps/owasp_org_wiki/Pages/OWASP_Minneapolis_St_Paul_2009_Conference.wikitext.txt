'''Topic:''' The Developers Guide to PCI DSS and PA-DSS Requirements 

The Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS) has a large number of requirements pertaining to the development and maintenance of payment applications. The requirements span development, maintenance, support, access controls, auditing &amp; logging, security awareness, assessment, and policies. Not only does this apply to the systems within a cardholder environment but also to supporting applications and your organization’s overall SDLC. Furthermore, these application specific requirements are often overlooked or misunderstood by development and information security departments. Within this presentation, we will review the most relevant PCI requirements that developers and application owners must focus on and how your organization can confidently comply.

'''Topic:''' Software Assurance Maturity Model (OpenSAMM) 

The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) ([http://www.opensamm.org/ http://www.opensamm.org/]) is a flexible and prescriptive framework for building security into a software development organization. Covering more than typical SDLC-based models for security, SAMM enables organizations to self-assess their security assurance program and then use recommended roadmaps to improve in a way that's aligned to the specific risks facing the organization. Beyond that, SAMM enables creation of scorecards for an organization's effectiveness at secure software development throughout the typical governance, development, and deployment business functions. Scorecards also enable management within an organization to demonstrate quantitative improvements through iterations of building a security assurance program. This workshop will introduce the SAMM framework and walk through useful activities such as assessing an assurance program, mapping an existing organization to a recommended roadmap, and iteratively building an assurance program. Time allowing, additional case studies will also be discussed. OpenSAMM is an open a free project and has recently been donated to the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Foundation. For more information on OpenSAMM, visit [http://www.opensamm.org/ http://www.opensamm.org/].

'''Topic:''' The Future of the Security Industry: IT is Rapidly Becoming a Commodity 

More companies are outsourcing their IT infrastructure -- treating it as a service more like electricity, office cleaning, or tax preparation -- and this has profound implications for IT security. Organizational users care less about the technical details of security. Products and services change their focus from the end user to the outsourcer. Industry consolidation results, as non-security IT infrastructure companies seek to bolster their security credentials. Even the profession changes, as jobs move from individual organizations to the outsourcing companies, and in some cases overseas. This talk looks at the future of IT security in a mature IT infrastructure industry. 
'''Bio''': (From [http://www.schneier.com/ schneier.com]) ''Bruce Schneier is an internationally renowned security technologist and author. Described by The Economist as a "security guru," he is best known as a refreshingly candid and lucid security critic and commentator. When people want to know how security really works, they turn to Schneier.''
