All that remains is to start the WebGoat lessons.

==One Last Point==
If the problems or solutions do not reveal themselves to you, there are hints available to guide you through the lessons. Don’t be too eager, though – application testing is 10% technique and 90% lateral thinking. You will learn and remember much more if you struggle through the puzzles posed by the lessons. This will force you through a large number of failed attempts and finally a flash of insight that brings you to the solution. You can blame it on the Goat, but you can’t rely on him.
