Change log of current development version: [[ORG (Owasp Report Generator) - Change Log]]

== ORG To-do  ==

Note: This section needs better formating

'''Current Main To-Do list'''

'''* Number	Difficulty	Priority	Request'''
* ''6	Intermediate	High''	Verify all current data against a schema and ensure that consistency is maintained (especially with IP Address / DNS Name fields)
* ''16	Minor	High''	Change the window menu to have the current open windows in the actual menu, rather than as a sub menu
* ''17	Intermediate	Low''	Add a find function to the source code editor
* ''22	Minor	Low''	Correct redundancy of report reviewers now that we have a document information page (remove these redundant tags)
* ''23	Minor	Low''	Verify metadata that we currently store is correct and valuable
* ''24	Minor	Low''	Correct spelling of confidenciality Rating in document information page
* ''5	Intermediate	Medium''	Enable verification against a schema within the tool to ensure that data is of a consistent form
* ''9	Intermediate	Medium''	Add a drop down menu to the findings screen to allow for the selection of a recommendation from the recommendations database
* ''13	Intermediate	Medium''	Create a Microsoft Word version of the report
* ''20	Intermediate	Medium''	Paste tables into Appendix
* ''21	Intermediate	Medium''	Paste images into Appendix
*                                      Add SpellCheking capabilities (using Authentic's component support for it)
*                                      Add support for saving GUI Settings (for example the Spliter sizes)
*                                      Fix bugs in additional details.  Hitting return doesn't not enter a newline.  
*                                      When adding a finding like "Bug found @ hehe/hehe.aspx" it does not work because of the information entered in (it doesn't like the "/").  Need to validate and sanitize the information.
*                                      Write unit tests

!  
|| Issues with new Authentic 2007 OCX control ||
* Report Contents SPS is not working (conflict with XSD) ,
* Keyboard hock not working properly (in axActiveAuthenticControl.@event.ctrlKey , axActiveAuthenticControl.@event.ctrlKey doesn't contain the correct value (i.e. in the case where is ctrlKey pressed and ctrlKey should be true)
|| Medium  || DC || getting there
|-
!  
|| Enable templates in executive summary to save copying and pasting in new projects || There is an easy and a hard way to do this. The easy is to implement this using template xml files which are copied to the target location (for example a finding or 'Report Content') from a default location (in the current plan the output of a plug-in). The hard way (but much more powerfull) will be to implement this templates using dinamic manipulation of the autentic object (which is something that I haven't figure out how to do) || Medium || Not Assigned
|-
!  
|| Convert Export functionality into a Plug-in || Should be easy to do since all code is already there || Low || DC ||
|-
!
|| Verify all current data against a schema and ensure that consistency is maintained (especially with IP Address / DNS Name fields) || Basicaly the issue here is that everytime an xml file is saved, a quick check to the schema should be made. The code to do this already exists (it is in the export data code). This can be done using the authentic component.  No need to write code. - Mike

! 
|| generated Pdf reports don't appear in the respective ORG window. || [DC]: this doesn't occour all the time and it is due to the fact that the current way used to display the pdf is to open it in the embebed IE control (which sometimes opens the pdf inside it and others in an external window || no idea || ||
|-
!
|| Remember the UI dimensions for every window when it closes. || The windows need to remember how they were set so that the next time the program is ran people do not have to resize the windows again.  This would be a nice usability addition || easy || ||

== To add to to-do ==

* Default headers auto populated in "Report Contents".  Executive Summary, Background, Scope
* Paste tables into Appendix
* Paste images into Appendix
* Bug report, sequence of events: 
** do findings
** then do exec sumamry
** then make a pdf
** then try to change a finding (exception will occur)
** if you reload the project the issue will go away
* feature: in the reports -> 2. choose a data filter: add the capabilty to define extraparameters for the external xslt transformation (this is needed for the new XSLT 2 xslts)

== TODO Future Versions ==
* Add in the ability to import in stock findings
* Add in tool tips to the forms.
