Since 2004, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has charged an uphill battle against a myriad of threats that loom over web based infrastructures. Today, our vision, as a global, non-profit leader in the area of application security, is focused on evolving the many projects, frameworks, and tools that have been produced and shared with companies and governments all around the world for nearly 7 yeares. The goal still remains the same - to defend the castle that is the web application environment. Our global organization, comprised of the best and brightest in the field of web application security, devote their time, energy, and research in order that an arsenal of tools and guidance can be leveraged immediately by organizations across the globe. A few of our most notable efforts include the OWASP Top Ten (periodic ranking of web application's top ten risks along with mitigation techniques), WebGoat (an educational web application that shows how attacks against vulnerabilities and design flaws can take place), Anti-SAMY (a codebase to leverage across .NET and Java web apps), ESAPI (Enterprise Security API - pluggable API to existing web applicaitons in order to sanitize input/ output).
