| project_home_page = OWASP Mobile Security Project
| project_description = Our primary focus is at the application layer.  While we take into consideration the underlying mobile platform and carrier inherent risks when threat modeling and building controls, we are targeting the areas that the average developer can make a difference.  Additionally, we focus not only on the mobile applications deployed to end user devices, but also on the broader server-side infrastructure which the mobile apps communicate with.  We focus heavily on the integration between the mobile application, remote authentication services, and cloud platform-specific features.
