==Chapter Activity Requirements==
While local chapters are required to hold at least 2 meetings (or chapter event) a year, it is recommended that chapters have a minimum of 4 meetings each year. 


[[Chapter_Leader_Handbook/GoToMeeting|Virtual meetings held via GotoMeeting]] or other online forum, will fulfill this activity requirement as long as the event is free and open to attendees.


==Inactive Chapters==
A chapter will be tagged as inactive if they have not hosted a meeting or event in over a year.  Additionally any chapter leaders will be removed from their position.  


If a leader has abandoned their chapter (left without finding a replacement leader) and no one has stepped up to take on the role, the chapter may also be tagged as inactive. 


Reporting an inactive chapter - http://sl.owasp.org/contactus.  If you think a chapter is inactive and are interested in helping out, we recommend reaching out to the chapter leader or board listed on the chapter’s wiki page as a starting point.  They may welcome you to take over the reins or let you know the status of the chapter.


==Restarting an Inactive Chapter==
The process for restarting an inactive chapter is the same as [[Chapter_Handbook/Chapter_3:_How_to_Start_a_Chapter#Start-up_Information|starting a new chapter]]. Instead of a new wiki page and mailing list being created, however, the new chapter leader will be listed on the existing wiki page and given administrative access to the mailing list.


==Call for Help==
Don’t be afraid to ask for help. Many chapter leaders have been in a situation where they wish they had more guidance on raising money, finding venues, finding speakers, attracting more members, and even handling conflicts within the chapters. The [mailto:owasp-chapters@lists.owasp.org owasp-chapters@lists.owasp.org]list was created especially for chapter leaders seeking advice or support of fellow chapter leaders. The [mailto:owasp-leaders@lists.owasp.org owasp-leaders@lists.owasp.org] is also a good option if you are looking to reach a wide range of OWASP supporters.


Many OWASP chapters have set up regional lists to facilitate communication with leaders in their close vicinity or regarding local issues.


Also, the Global Chapters Committee and OWASP Operational Team are available to support chapters and help generate solutions. They can be reached through the [http://sl.owasp.org/contactus contact us form].
