 # Talk: "Cloud Control: Assurance in a Massively Scalable World" by Ben Tomhave
 # Firetalks!&nbsp;:)


'''[http://owaspnova120111.eventbrite.com/ Please RSVP]'''


'''Presentation Title:''' "Cloud Control: Assurance in a Massively Scalable World"

'''Abstract:'''
Ubiquitous access to data and applications is here. No longer are our resources confined to enterprise networks and data centers of our own making. Rather, applications and platforms are now available on-demand, anywhere, anytime, to virtually anybody. Moreover, these environments can scale on demand, automating what has traditionally required expertise in system design and capacity planning. Assuring security in this environment poses new and evolving challenges. While they may resemble the same obstacles we've been managing for decades, they are increasingly more difficult to address. Now, more than ever, companies need to extend their governance, risk, and compliance initiatives to take cloud-related strategies and initiatives into account to proactively protect their data and their bottom line.

 # Talk: "Lessons Learned from the SQL Injection Challenge" by Ryan Barnett (Trustwave SpiderLabs)
 # Firetalks!&nbsp;:)

'''Presentation Title:''' "Lessons Learned from the SQL Injection Challenge"

'''Abstract:'''
How effective are blacklist filters vs. SQL Injection attacks?  What is the failure rate vs. automated scanning or manual testing?  Are there any "Time-to-Bypass" metrics?  In an attempt to answer these questions, Trustwave SpiderLabs' Research Team (the development team behind the ModSecurity WAF and the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set) held a community "SQL Injection Challenge" to test the effectiveness of the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set protections.  This presentation will provide an overview of the challenge, a step-by-step walk-through of the bypass tactics used by the winners, as well as, present a new approach to attack detection using ModSecurity's Lua API to perform Bayesian analysis.

'''Speaker Bio:'''

The fundamental culture of the average business does not encourage making good security decisions. Software shops continue to focus on functionality and timelines, neglecting information security. In spite of regulations like PCI and HIPAA+HITECH, which are levying fines against organizations for their security failures, the tipping point has clearly not been reached to cause meaningful change. Much of this problem can be attributed to the excessive use of negative incentives (sticks) instead of providing positive incentives (carrots) that inspire better decision making and motivate true change. Fortunately, it's not too late to change tactics and start achieving demonstrable success.<br> '''Speaker Bio:''' Ben Tomhave is a Senior Security Analyst with Gemini Security Solutions in Chantilly, VA, specializing in solutions architecture, security planning, program development and management, and other strategic security solutions.

A redux of the presentation that Alex delivered at B-Sides San Francisco during RSA 2010. "Now that the industry is trying to formalize the concept of risk management into neat little compartments like standards (ISO 27005/31000), certifications (CRISC) and products (GRC) guess what? We're doing it wrong. Fundamentally wrong. This talk will discuss why all this current risk management stuff is goofy and what sort of alternatives we have that might help us understand our ability to protect, our tendency towards failure, and how to match that up with what management will stomach."

'''DATE''': Thursday, September 3, 2009. 6:00pm.<br> '''LOCATION''': 13200 Woodland Park Road Herndon, VA 20171<br> '''TOPIC''': "Conducting Application Assessment"<br> '''SPEAKER''': Jeremy Epstein, SRI<br> '''DESCRIPTION''': 

After the 2000 election, many states launched headlong into electronic voting systems to avoid the problems with "hanging chads". Once problems with those systems started appearing, many localities started moving to optical scan, which was used by a majority of US voters in the 2008 election. There are other technologies in use around the country, including lever machines, vote-by-mail, vote-by-phone, and Internet voting. What are the tradeoffs among these technologies? Particularly relevant to OWASP, what are the security issues associated with different types of equipment, and what measures do vendors of voting equipment use to try to address the security problems? Are software security problems important, or can non-technical measures protect against them? In this talk, we'll discuss a wide variety of voting technologies, and their pros and cons from both a technical and societal perspective. 

'''ABOUT THE SPEAKER''': 

Jeremy Epstein is Senior Computer Scientist at SRI International. His background includes more than 20 years experience in computer security research, product development, and consulting. Prior to joining SRI International, he was Principal Consultant with Cigital, and before that spent nine years as Senior Director of Product Security at Software AG, an international business software company. Within the area of voting systems, Jeremy has been involved for over five years in voting technology and advocacy, both as an employee and as an independent consultant.

=== July 2009  ===

'''DATE''': July 9th 6pm-9pm EST<br> '''LOCATION''': 13200 Woodland Park Road Herndon, VA 20171<br> '''TOPIC''': "Ounce's 02"<br> '''SPEAKER(S)''': Dinis Cruz, OWASP, Ounce Labs.<br> '''DESCRIPTION''': So what is O2? 

Well in my mind O2 is a combination of advanced tools (Technology) which are designed to be used on a particular way (Process) by knowledgeable Individuals (People) 

Think about it as a Fighter Jet who is able to go very fast, has tons of controls, needs to be piloted by somebody who knows what they are doing and needs to have a purpose (i.e. mission). 

Basically what I did with O2 was to automate the workflow that I have when I'm engaged on a source-code security review. 

Now, here is the catch, this version is NOT for the faint-of-heart. I designed this to suit my needs, which although are the same as most other security consultants, have its own particularities&nbsp;:) 

The whole model of O2 development is based around the concept of automating a security consultant’s brain, so I basically ensure that the main O2 Developer (Dinis Cruz) has a very good understanding of the feature requirements of the targeted Security Consultant (Dinis Cruz)&nbsp;:) . And this proved (even to my surprise) spectacularly productive, since suddenly I (i.e. the security consultant) didn't had to wait months for new features to be added to its toolkit. If there was something that needed to be added, it would just be added in days or hours.

''Ryan C. Barnett, Breach Security'': '''Patching Challenge: Securing WebGoat with ModSecurity''' 

Identification of web application vulnerabilities is only half the battle with remediation efforts as the other. Let's face the facts, there are many real world business scenarios where it is not possible to update web application code in either a timely manner or at all. This is where the tactical use-case of implementing a web application firewall to address identified issues proves its worth. 

This talk will provide an overview of the recommended practices for utilizing a web application firewall for virtual patching. After discussing the framework to use, we will then present a very interesting OWASP Summer of Code Project where the challenge was to attempt to mitigate as many of the OWASP WebGoat vulnerabilities as possible using the open source ModSecurity web application firewall. During the talk, we will discuss both WebGoat and ModSecurity and provide in-depth walk-throughs of some of the complex fixes. Examples will include addressing not only attacks but the underlying vulnerabilities, using data persistence for multiple-step processes, content injection and even examples of the new LUA programming language API. The goal of this talk is to both highlight cutting edge mitigation options using a web application firewall and to show how it can effectively be used by security consultants who traditionally could only offer source code fixes. 

Ryan C. Barnett is the Director of Application Security Research at Breach Security and leads Breach Security Labs. He is also a Faculty Member for the SANS Institute, Team Lead for the Center for Internet Security Apache Benchmark Project and a Member of the Web Application Security Consortium where he leads the Distributed Open Proxy Honeypot Project. Mr. Barnett has also authored a web security book for Addison/Wesley Publishing entitled "Preventing Web Attacks with Apache."

=== January 2009  ===

To kick off 2009, our January meeting featured a discussion of the relationship between application security and CMMI, and an overview of the OWASP ASVS project. 

''Michele Moss, Booz Allen Hamilton'': '''Evolutions In The Relationship Between Application Security And The CMMI''' 

Addressing new and complex threats and IT security challenges requires repeatable, reliable, rapid, and cost effective solutions. To implement these solutions, organizations have begun to align their security improvement efforts with their system and software development practices. During a “Birds of a Feather” at the March 2007 SEPG, a group of industry representatives initiated an effort which led to the definition of assurance practices that can be applied in the context of the CMMI. This presentation will provide an understanding how applying the assurance practices in the context of security contribute to the overall increased quality of products and services, illustrate how the a focus on assurance in the context of CMMI practices is related to application security practices, and present and approach to evaluate and improve the repeatability and reliability of assurance practices. 

Michele Moss, CISSP, is a security engineer with more than 12 years of experience in process improvement. She specializes in integrating assurance processes and practices into project lifecycles. Michele is the Co-Chair of the DHS Software Assurance Working Group on Processes &amp; Practices. She has assisted numerous organizations with maturing their information technology, information assurance, project management, and support practices through the use of the capability maturity models including the CMMI, and the SSE-CMM. She is one of the key contributors in an effort to apply an assurance focus to CMMI.

''Mike Boberski, Booz Allen Hamilton'': '''About OWASP ASVS''' 

The primary aim of the OWASP ASVS Project is to normalize the range of coverage and level of rigor available in the market when it comes to performing application-level security verification. The goal is to create a set of commercially-workable open standards that are tailored to specific web-based technologies. 

Mike Boberski works at Booz Allen Hamilton. He has a background in application security and the use of cryptography by applications. He is experienced in trusted product evaluation, security-related software development and integration, and cryptomodule testing. For OWASP, he is the project lead and a co-author of the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard, the first OWASP standard.

=== November 2008  ===

For our November 2008 meeting, we had two great presentations on software assurance and security testing. 

''Nadya Bartol, Booz Allen Hamilton'': '''Framework for Software Assurance''' 

Nadya's presentation will provide an update on the Software Assurance Forum efforts to establish a comprehensive framework for software assurance (SwA) and security measurement. The Framework addresses measuring achievement of SwA goals and objectives within the context of individual projects, programs, or enterprises. It targets a variety of audiences including executives, developers, vendors, suppliers, and buyers. The Framework leverages existing measurement methodologies, including Practical Software and System Measurement (PSM); CMMI Goal, Question, Indicator, Measure (GQ(I)M); NIST SP 800-55 Rev1; and ISO/IEC 27004 and identifies commonalities among the methodologies to help organizations integrate SwA measurement in their overall measurement efforts cost-effectively and as seamlessly as possible, rather than establish a standalone SwA measurement effort within an organization. The presentation will provide an update on the SwA Forum Measurement Working Group work, present the current version of the Framework and underlying measures development and implementation processes, and propose example SwA measures applicable to a variety of SwA stakeholders. The presentation will update the group on the latest NIST and ISO standards on information security measurement that are being integrated into the Framework as the standards are being developed.

''Paco Hope, Cigital'': '''The Web Security Testing Cookbook''' 

The Web Security Testing Cookbook (O'Reilly &amp; Associates, October 2008) gives developers and testers the tools they need to make security testing a regular part of their development lifecycle. Its recipe style approach covers manual, exploratory testing as well automated techniques that you can make part of your unit tests or regression cycle. The recipes cover the basics like observing messages between clients and servers, to multi-phase tests that script the login and execution of web application features. This book complements many of the security texts in the market that tell you what a vulnerability is, but not how to systematically test it day in and day out. Leverage the recipes in this book to add significant security coverage to your testing without adding significant time and cost to your effort.

=== History  ===

The original DC Chapter was founded in June 2004 by [mailto:jeff.williams@owasp.org Jeff Williams] and has had members from Virginia to Delaware. In April 2005 a new chapter, OWASP Washington VA Local Chapter, was formed and the DC Chapter was renamed to DC-Maryland. The two are sister chapters and include common members and shared discourse. The chapters meet in opposite halves of the month to facilitate this relationship. 

==== Chapter Groups  ====

Within the chapter, various common interests spring up. We've created Google groups to manage collaboration amongst participants for these topics. Feel free to join and participate in:
