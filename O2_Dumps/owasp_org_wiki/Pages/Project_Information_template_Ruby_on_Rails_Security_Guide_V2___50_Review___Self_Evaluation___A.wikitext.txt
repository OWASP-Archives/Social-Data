3. What kind of help is required either from the Reviewers or from the OWASP Community?
 | colspan="2" style="width:75%; background:#cccccc" align="left"| I'd like to have a professional and good looking design for my guide. I planned to hire someone for this, but then I found the "Book Cover & Sleeve Design" project in this year's Soc. Will that be for everyone, so we have a good corp. design? Otherwise this is my suggestion, to have a general, professional design (I've got a designer, I could ask him).
