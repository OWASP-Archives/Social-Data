Here is some sample code that can be used to detect CIE3.  If you know that a null byte is never acceptable in your app, you could put this in a filter, and call it for all incoming data (request headers, cookie data, request parameters, etc) 

<pre>
String myInputParameter = ...;

//the execution of this line will create an exception if an attack is found 
boolean isParamSafe = AttackDetectorUtils.verifyNullByteDoesNotExist(myInputParameter); 
if (! isParamSafe) {
    notify user ...&nbsp;???
}
</pre>
