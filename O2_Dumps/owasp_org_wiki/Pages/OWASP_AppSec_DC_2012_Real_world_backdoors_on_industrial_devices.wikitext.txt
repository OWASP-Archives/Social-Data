== The Presentation  ==
The ICS security, or the lack of, has been hogging the titles during the last months. The underlying issue behind this fact is that, in a post-stuxnet era, the industrial control systems are facing a totally new scenario, they are not a safe place anymore but a potential and valuable target. A lot of questions arise, but maybe the most important one is: are they prepared to face this threat? This presentation details the whole process of analyzing industrial devices, including methods such as reverse engineering and open source intelligence.<br>The results of this approach are also elaborated, showing real cases of backdoors found on widely deployed PLCs and SmartMeters
