__NOTOC__ 
==Description==
'''Course Length: 1 Day'''


Web applications are the new frontier of wide‐spread security breaches. This tutorial will guide through development practices to ensure the security and integrity of web applications, in turn protecting user data and the infrastructure the application runs on. Several attack types and risks will be reviewed (including OWASP’s Top 10), along with how the proper development practices can mitigate their damage. Although examples covered are PHP‐based, much of the content is also applicable to other languages.

This will be an updated, encore presentation of last year’s well received course.  Following are quotes from prior ''WebAppSec.php'' attendees:

:: ''"Presented in a very structured format.  Instructor knew his stuff.  Good presentations."''

:: ''"Very knowledgeable!  Covered a lot of topics in a limited amount of time"''
 
:: ''"The presenter was excellent.  He didn't present an overload of information.  The day went very quickly and I am leaving with a lot of valuable information"''

:: ''"The slides were excellent - full of good code examples and explanations"''

:: ''"Material that was presented was presented and covered well.  Instructor is very knowledgeable"''

:: ''"Handouts & presentation well organized & coordinated"''

All course registrants will receive printed materials and a certificate of completion which may be used for documenting CPE credits.

==Student Requirements==
None

==Objectives==
Skill: Any - some knowledge of web development will be helpful

Attendees will gain the knowledge required to develop secure web applications, along with an understanding of various attack types against web apps and how they are mitigated by the proper coding techniques. The main learning objectives are:
# Developing the skills for securely coding web applications
# Reviewing existing web vulnerabilities and their impact
# Understanding how the proper development techniques mitigates known and some unknown web vulnerabilities
