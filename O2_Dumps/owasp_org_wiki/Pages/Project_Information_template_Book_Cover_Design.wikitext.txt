 | colspan="6" style="width:85%; background:#cccccc" align="left"|'''Book Cover Design Series Brief''': LXstudios has had the pleasure of speaking with Dinis Cruz about OWASP (book) publications. We discussed the current scenario and the potential for stronger OWASP brand identity across publication lines, and the packaging of these publications into book sleeves. We discussed the importance of this effort as OWASP is growing exponentially. OWASP produces many publications a year. Currently, the publications have cover designs and good content. The cover designs are all different. There is a lot of potential for these covers to look consistent from a brand perspective, and adding end-user value to the purchase of a book. There is also functional reason for the redesign, as Dinis would like to identify the different release versions of a book and it’s quality of content. As OWASP grows and produces more literature, a scalable cover design strategy must be employed so that the publications stay organized, easy to implement, easy to understand, increase brand identity, and sell. '''Book Sleeve Design Brief''': Dinis and I also discussed the delivery of these books in professionally-produced book sleeves. This book sleeve would house between 6-8 OWASP publications and create an identity for a suite of books on a reader’s book shelf. As a reader’s collection of OWASP literature grows, the organization of these books comes into play. The other valuable reason to create a book sleeve is the individual and corporate membership. When these members buy into OWASP, the professional delivery of the publications is paramount. Bottom line: in addition to functional book covers and securing shelf space, OWASP has an increasing and critical need to look as good or better than other industry publications in circulation.
