'''Web 2.0, Consumerization, and Application Security, Chenxi Wang, Ph.D., Principal Analyst, Forrester Research.'''

As Enterprises are increasingly connected to the Internet and as hard organizational boundaries are fast disappearing, security professionals are facing fresh challenges in Enterprise computing: responding to new threats brought on by Web 2.0 and the increasing consumerization of enterprises, dealing with complex interaction models beyond your Intranet, and struggling to keep proprietary information secure in a collaboration-centric culture. One crucial element of success in this environment is application security, which serves as a foundation to all information security initiatives. This talk will examine how the adoption of Web 2.0 and consumer technologies impact application security and how you should respond to the new requirements. More specifically, we will cover these topics: 
*Global trends on Web 2.0 adoption, de-perimeterization, and the consumerization of corporate IT and how these trends impact enterprise security.   
*The top security risks in an open and collaboration oriented architecture and what you can do to mitigate these risks from an application security perspective. 
*An overall application security maturity model, and steps to take to become a center of excellence in application security.
