'''Topic: ''' Testing From the Cloud: Is the Sky Falling?
 
More and more IT is being moved to the cloud, why shouldn't your testing
move there too? This talk will cover what it takes to take your testing
tools from your laptop to the cloud using new features of the OWASP Web
Testing Environment (WTE). WTE allows you to create custom installations
of application security tools in the cloud on demand. Has your IP been
shunned? No problem, kill that cloud instance and startup another. Is
your life as mobile as your phone? No problem, a laptop + Internet =
access to all your favorite tools from anywhere. Multiple clients? No
problem, start an an instance for each one. By the end of this talk,
you'll know all you need to fire up an cloud instance with all of your
favorite tools and start having fun.

'''Topic: Half-Day Threat Modeling Seminar with John Steven of Cigital'''

How will attackers break your web application? How much security testing is enough? Do I have to worry about insiders? Threat modeling, applied with a risk management approach can answer both of these questions if done correctly. This talk will present advanced threat modeling step-wise through examples and exercises using the Java EE platform and focusing on authentication, authorization, and session management.

Participants will learn, through interactive exercise on real software architectures, how to use diagramming techniques to explicitly document threats their applications face, identify how assets worth protecting manifest themselves within the system, and enumerate the attack vectors these threats take advantage of. Participants will then engage in secure design activities, learning how to use the threat model to specify compensating controls for specified attack vectors. Finally, we'll discuss how the model can drive security testing and validate an application resists specified attack.

'''Topic: ''' STAAF: A FLOSS Framework for Scalable and Sharable Android App Analysis

With no end of Android malware anywhere in sight, it’s no wonder that so many Android analysis tools have been released lately.  While each of these powerful tools makes great strides in finding artifacts in an individual application, they’re typically not designed to scale beyond a few thousand selected samples at most.  In order to effective insight into android applications researchers need to be be able to analyze a substantial subset of the 300k+ applications in the official store, all of the applications across the disparate unofficial Android stores and repositories, as well as ad-hoc manually-submitted applications.  This was the motivation for STAAF, a Scalable Tailored Application Analysis Framework.  STAAF was designed to allow an analyst to easily add/remove/configure various analysis modules, then process large numbers of applications at once or over time, then share the raw data, processed data, and results with other organizations.  In this presentation I’ll cover the STAAF Architecture, the current status and available implementation, and if circumstances permit, show a quick demo with a handful of applications.

'''Topic: ''' Protecting Your Applications from Backdoors: How to Secure Your Business Critical Applications from Time Bombs, Backdoors & Data Exfiltration

With the increasing practice of outsourcing and using 3rd party libraries, it is nearly impossible for an enterprise to identify the pedigree and security of the software running its business critical applications. As a result backdoors and malicious code are increasingly becoming the prevalent attack vector used by hackers. Whether you manage internal development activities, work with third party developers or are developing a COTS application for enterprise, your mandate is clear- safeguard your code and make applications security a priority for internal and external development teams. 

In this session we will cover:

* Prevalence of backdoors and malicious code in third party attacks 

* Definitions and classifications of backdoors and their impact on your applications 

* Methods to identify, track and remediate these vulnerabilities

'''Topic: ''' Introduction to the OWASP Secure Coding Practices Quick Reference Guide

The OWASP Secure Coding Practices Quick Reference Guide is a technology agnostic set of general software security coding practices, in a comprehensive checklist format, that can be integrated into the development life-cycle. At only 17 pages long, it is easy to read and digest.

The focus is on secure coding requirements, rather than on vulnerabilities and exploits. In this respect it is targeted more precisely for the development community, as opposed to the security community.

This presentation will introduce this OWASP project and discuss some of the core concepts and principles of the requirements.

'''Topic: ''' Rugged Dev: Building Reliability and Security Into Software

Complex systems fail over time and the larger they are, the more likely they are to fail in unforeseen ways. Come hear about the best practices we used and lessons learned when we built very large scale cloud-based products. Once exposed to the Internet, complex multi-tenant Web systems encounter a wide range of input from a variety of sources but still have to be long running and behave resiliently in the face of failures. We will examine 3 implementations of Rugged best practices to design and test your software for ruggedness.

'''Topic: ''' Supercharged Password Cracking Techniques

In the past 2-3 years there have been many important discoveries/releases in
the world of password cracking. Between massive password leaks (like RockYou,
Gawker, etc) and the release of many free tools that take advantage of 
the processing power of GPU cards, there are many new techniques/tools/tricks
that security professionals should be taking advantage of while cracking 
passwords. But, by default tools you download (Like John the Ripper) do not
take advantage of this.

Over the past 12 years, Rick has been collecting password hashes from various
large corporations (during authorized penetration tests). For years now, he 
has been cracking these passwords, and discovering more and more patterns that
users are using. But the majority of password cracking tools out there
(Such as John the Ripper, L0phtCrack, etc) do not take advantage of these 
"human weaknesses" in password creation. So far Rick has cracked almost 4 
million hashes from inside corporate America, and an additional 5+ million 
from sources over the Internet.

During this talk Rick will talk about the current state of password cracking
by walking the attendees through a PWDUMP output file containing 49000+ 
real "complex" NTLM passwords) how the default rule-set provided by John 
the Ripper can be improved to crack tens of thousands of additional passwords. 
Wordlists/Dictionaries will be shared that can help you better crack 
passwords (these wordlists were created based on what users are _actually_ 
doing in Fortune 500 environments). New "rules" will be given out that were 
created to specifically attack the patterns that users are choosing.

This is relevant to OWASP, because the applications we are developing/securing
almost always have logins and passwords that protect them. But, unlike Operating
Systems, our web applications do not usually have strict password requirements
that users have to meet in order to create an account. We do this as to not
scare away users; but we are placing our OWN systems at risk. 

Even now, sites like Google/Twitter/Facebook only warn the users about poor
passwords, or have a list of 500 passwords that are not allowed. This will
_not_ be the case in 10 years.  Lets address this problem now.

The only way to address the problem, is to first become aware of how bad
our users are at choosing passwords , and what we can do (as developers or
security professionals) to help protect our users from themselves.

'''Topic: ''' Smart Phones with Dumb Apps

Enterprises are targeting both internal users and customers with smartphone applications for platforms such as Apple iPhone and Google Android. Many of these applications are constructed without fully considering the associated security implications of their deployment. Breaches can impact both users as well as the enterprise distributing the application as attackers take advantage of expanded access to sensitive data and network services. This talk discusses emerging threats associated with deploying smartphone applications and provides an overview of the threat modeling process. The presentation then walks example applications from an attacker’s perspective demonstrating the sort of information they are able to extract allowing for more advanced attacks.

'''Topic: ''' Application Assessments Reloaded

Trying to integrate Business Software Assurance into Enterprise Risk Management and Information Security Management programs has had issues over the years. Penetration-testing was announced dead over a year ago, but it's still the number one choice of application security professionals when starting out. Can the activities from penetration-testing be re-used and turned into something innovative?

Tools (especially application scanners and secure static analysis tools) have error rates so high, they are useless in the hands of newcomers (even for peripheral security testing). Some organizations have built entire applications around or on top of existing appsec tools. Others are looking to use other kinds of tools, such as process/methodology/workflow tools, to enhance their classic penetration-testing tools.

Even the testing/inspection methodologies themselves are outdated and we're finding that they are challenging or repetitive in many environments. How do current appsec tools and testing/inspection methods work in the cloud? If we re-run the same kinds of tests during dev-test, software quality, and application security cycles, aren't we wasting valuable time and effort?

This presentation will provide discussion around how to solve many of these and other challenges in application security. The focus will be on web applications that use common technologies (HTTP, SQL, Classic XML/HTML, Javascript, Flash) but also updated to today's standards (RESTful transactions, NoSQL, HTML5, Ajax/Json, Flex2).

'''Topic: ''' Automated vs. Manual Security: You can't filter The Stupid 

Everyone wants to stretch their security budget, and automated application security tools are an appealing choice for doing so. However, manual security testing isn’t going anywhere until the HAL application scanner comes online. This presentation will use often humorous, real-world examples to illustrate the relative strengths and weaknesses of automated solutions and manual techniques. 

<br> Automated tools have some strengths, namely low incremental cost, detecting simple vulnerabilities, and performing highly repetitive tasks. However, automated solutions are far from perfect. There are entire classes of vulnerabilities that are theoretically impossible for automated software to detect. Examples include complex information leakage, race conditions, logic flaws, design flaws, and multistage process attacks. Beyond that, there are many vulnerabilities that are too complicated or obscure to practically detect with an automated tool.

'''Topic: ''' Reducing Your Data Security Risk Through Tokenization 

The first Austin OWASP meeting of the year is on a really interesting topic that many of you have probably never thought about: Tokenization. The concept is simple...use tokens to represent your data instead of passing around the data itself. For example, why would you give a customer account representative a full credit card number when all they need to do their job is the last four digits? Using tokenization, we are able to reduce the data security risk by limiting the number of systems that actually store the data. This extremely simplifies audits for regulations like SOX, HIPAA, and PCI DSS. This presentation will cover the business drivers for data protection, what tokenization is, and how to implement it. If your organization has data to protect, then you're going to want to check out this presentation.

Good metrics must lack subjectivity and clearly aid decision makers to determine areas that need improvement. In this presentation we’ll discuss metrics used to classify and appropriately compare security vulnerabilities found in different phases of the SDL by different teams working in different locations and in different products. We’ll also discuss how to easily provide decision makers different views of the same data and verify whether the process is indeed catching critical vulnerabilities internally.

'''Topic: ''' Vulnerability Management In An Application Security World 

Identifying application-level vulnerabilities via penetration tests and code reviews is only the first step in actually addressing the underlying risk. Managing vulnerabilities for applications is more challenging than dealing with traditional infrastructure-level vulnerabilities because they typically require the coordination of security teams with application development teams and require security managers to secure time from developers during already-cramped development and release schedules. In addition, fixes require changes to custom application code and application-specific business logic rather than the patches and configuration changes that are often sufficient to address infrastructure-level vulnerabilities. 

This presentation details many of the pitfalls organizations encounter while trying to manage application-level vulnerabilities as well as outlines strategies security teams can use for communicating with development teams. Similarities and differences between security teams’ practice of vulnerability management and development teams’ practice of defect management will be addressed in order to facilitate healthy communication between these groups.

For this month's presentation, we diverge from the typical OWASP topics of writing secure code, testing to make sure your code is secure, and other code related topics and delve into the process of actually architecting a secure web application from the ground up. We'll start with some basic n-tier architecture (web vs app vs DB), throw in some firewall and DMZ concepts, then talk about server hardening with client firewalls (iptables), disabling services, and other techniques. Whether you're a code monkey wondering how the rest of the world works, a security guy trying to figure out what you're missing, or an auditor just trying to understand how the pieces fit together, this presentation is for you.

'''Topic: ''' Web Application Security in the Airline Industry: Stealing the Airlines’ Online Data 

In this session, attendees will learn about the types of airline data that is at risk of being stolen by online data thieves. In addition, the following topics will be further explored: 

1. Important attack scenarios and Web-based vulnerabilities accompanied by examples of how these attacks can be mitigated by deploying comprehensive defense solutions; 

2. Protection strategies and tools, such as Web application scanners and Web application firewalls, which help equalize the gap between the advanced Web hacker and the security professional; and 

3. Compliance and Software development life cycle approaches. 

Following the September 11 attacks, the airline industry recognized its need to ‘webify’ online ticket reservation systems, crew scheduling, and passenger profiles in order to enhance operational efficiency. This ultimately served to decrease the airlines’ operating costs, thereby increasing their operating profits. However, the following questions remain: At what costs? What are the information systems and customer data security risks associated with the airline ‘webification’ process? 

Please join in this presentation, which will outline some of the challenges that members of the airlines industry may face when attempting to protect their online services. Additionally, attendees will discover methodologies that airlines may utilize to identify, assess, and protect against the various risks associated with Web-based application attacks.

<br> '''Topic: ''' Securely Handling Sensitive Configuration Data. 

One of the age old problems with web applications was keeping sensitive data available on a need to know basis. The classic case of this is database credentials. The application needs them to connect to the database but developers shouldn't have direct access to the DB - particularly the production DB. The presentation will discuss how we took on this specific problem, our determination that this was a specific case of a more general problem and how we solved that general problem. In our solution, sensitive data is only available to the application and trusted 3rd parties (e.g. DBAs). We will then cover our implementation of that solution in a .Net 2.0 environment and discuss some options for J2EE environments. So far, we used our .Net solution successfully for database credentials and private encryption keys used in XML-DSig. Sensitive data is only available to the application and trusted 3rd parties (e.g. DBAs).

'''Who:''' Nathan Sportsman and Praveen Kalamegham, Web Services Security 

'''Topic: '''Web Services Security The concept of web services has become ubiquitous over the last few years. Frameworks are now available across many platforms and languages to greatly ease and expedite the development of web services, often with a vast amount of existing code reuse. Software companies are taking advantage of this by integrating this technology into their products giving increased power and interoperability to their customers. However, the power web services enables also introduces new risks to an environment. As with web applications, development has outpaced the understanding and mitigation of vulnerabilities that arise from this emerging technology. This presentation will first aim to identify the risks associated with web services. We will describe the existing security standards and technologies which target web services (i.e., WS-Security) including its history, pros and cons, and current status. Finally we will attempt to extrapolate the future of this space to determine what changes must be made going forward.

'''What:''' Security – The Road Less Travelled 

Abstract - What do you think Shakespeare had to say about Software Security? What does an naked motorist have to do with Confidentiality? What does the Jungle Book character Baloo have to say about Security Essentials (The Bear Bare Necessities of Life security)? What does the African Wildlife have to do with Security Concepts? What does pH have to do with Security? and more … The Road Less Travelled by renowed poet, Robert Frost ends by with the statement “And that has made all the difference”. Come to find out the answers to the questions above and see what it takes to look at Security from a different perspective, that would make ALL the difference. The session will cover not only the higher level abstractions of security concepts, but will dive deep wherever applicable into concepts and code, making it a MUST attend for Development, QA, PM and Management Staff on both the IT and Business side. Also, if you are interested in becoming a CISSP® or SSCP®, come find out about the official (ISC)2 self-assessment tool developed by Express Certifications to aid candidates in their study efforts and how you can get valuable discounts.

Dan Cornell has over ten years of experience architecting and developing web-based software systems. He leads Denim Group's security research team in investigating the application of secure coding and development techniques to improve web-based software development methodologies. 

'''Topic: '''Static Analysis Techniques for Testing Application Security 

Static Analysis of software refers to examining source code and other software artifacts without executing them. This presentation looks at how these techniques can be used to identify security defects in applications. Approaches examined will range from simple keyword search methods used to identify calls to banned functions through more sophisticated data flow analysis used to identify more complicated issues such as injection flaws. In addition, a demonstration will be given of two freely-available static analysis tools: FindBugs for the Java platform and FXCop for the .NET platform. Finally, some approaches will be presented on how organizations can start using static analysis tools as part of their development and quality assurance processes.

'''When:''' December 4th, 2007, 11:30am - 1:00pm 

'''Who:''' Jeremiah Grossman (WhiteHat Security, CTO, OWASP Founder, Security Blogger) 

'''Topic: Business Logic Flaws''' 

Session handling, credit card transactions, and password recovery are just a few examples of Web-enabled business logic processes that malicious hackers have abused to compromise major websites. These types of vulnerabilities are routinely overlooked during QA because the process is intended to test what a piece of code is supposed to do and not what it can be made to do. The other problem(s) with business logic flaws is scanners can’t identify them, IDS can’t detect them, and Web application firewalls can’t defend them. Plus, the more sophisticated and Web 2.0 feature-rich a website, the more prone it is to have flaws in business logic. 

This presentation will provide real-world demonstrations of how pernicious and dangerous business logic flaws are to the security of a website. He’ll also show how best to spot them and provide organizations with a simple and rational game plan to prevent them.

=Sponsorship Opportunities=

The Austin OWASP Chapter can offer your company three unique sponsorship opportunities. If you are interested in taking advantage of any of these opportunities, please contact [mailto:josh.sokol@ni.com Josh Sokol], the Austin OWASP Chapter President. 

'''Opportunity #1 - Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour Sponsorship''' 

The Austin OWASP Chapter organizes a monthly Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour event along with the Capitol of Texas ISSA Chapter. This event has historically drawn around 30 of Austin's finest security professionals for networking and more. Your sponsorship of this event includes appetizers and drinks for the attendees. We typically do $100 in appetizers and $200 in drink tickets. By using drink tickets, we ensure that our sponsors are able to interact with every attendee who wants a drink. Feel free to pass out business cards and network just like you would anywhere else. You'll find no better opportunity to get your name in front of 30+ security professionals for around $300. 

'''Opportunity #2 - OWASP Meeting Lunch Sponsorship''' 

Our monthly Austin OWASP meetings are held during a person's typical lunch hours from 11:30 AM to 1:00 PM. For your sponsorship of around $250 we can arrange food and drinks for up to 50 attendees. In exchange for your sponsorship, our chapter will provide you with 5 minutes at the start of the meeting to introduce yourself and tell us about the products or services that your company offers. You'll also receive mention of being the lunch sponsor in all e-mail communications about the meeting. 

'''Opportunity #3 - OWASP Meeting Presenter Sponsorship''' 

Although OWASP is a non-profit organization, we strive to provide our members with the best presenters we possibly can. While the Austin area has tons of security talent, sometimes it's worthwhile to reach beyond our borders to pull in more awesome presenters. In exchange for covering travel expenses for these presenters, our chapter will provide you with 5 minutes at the start of the meeting to introduce yourself and tell us about the products or services that your company offers. You'll also receive mention of being the presenter sponsor in all e-mail communications about the meeting. 

The Austin OWASP Chapter would like to thank [http://www.setsolutions.com Set Solutions], [http://www.bluecoat.com Blue Coat Systems],[http://www.fireeye.com FireEye], [http://www.veracode.com Veracode], [http://www.expandingsecurity.com Expanding Security], [http://www.infoblox.com Infoblox], [http://www.cisco.com Cisco], [http://www.rapid7.com Rapid7], [http://www.f5.com F5], [http://www.accuvant.com Accuvant], and [http://www.whitehatsec.com WhiteHat Security] for their sponsorships during the past year.
