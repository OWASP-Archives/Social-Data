== Planning the new OWASP Testing Guide v3 ==

'''3rd October 2007: Startup v3''' <br>
The OWASP Testing Guide v2 was a great success, with thousand download and many many Companies that have adopted it as standard for a Web Application Penetration Testing. <br>
Now we would like to begin a new project that is based on v2 but improve it and complete it. <br>
<br>
In the OWASP Testing Guide v2 we have split the set of tests in 8 sub-categories: 
* Information Gathering 
* Business Logic Testing 
* Authentication Testing 
* Session Management Testing 
* Data Validation Testing 
* Denial of Service Testing 
* Web Services Testing 
* AJAX Testing

The following are my thoughts about the new OWASP Testing Guide v3:

1) Authorization testing missing. As Jeff and Dave said many time before it's important to create a new category.<br>
* This should include things which were in v1 but dropped from v2, like: OWASP-AC-003 :	Authorization Parameter Manipulation, OWASP-AC-004 : Authorized pages/functions 
2)	Information gathering is not a set of vulnerabilities --> not in report --> new category: Passive mode <br>
3)	Business logic testing --> not in report --> Passive mode  <br>
4)	Infrastructural test --> new category <br>
5)	Web Services section needs improvement <br>
6)	AJAX Testing section needs improvement <br>
7)	New category: Client side Testing. AJAX and Flash Testing  <br>


This [http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:Planning_OTGv3.doc document] analyzes the OWASP Testing Guide v2 vulnerabilities and a plan for create the new v3.<br><br>

The following clarifications/considerations also need to be made in preparation for v3:<br>
1) Are "OWASP-AUTHN-001 : Authentication endpoint request should be HTTPS" and "OWASP-AUTHN-003 : Credentials transport over an encrypted channel" as they were in v1 fully covered by "OWASP-IG-005 : SSL/TLS Testing"? '''--> no, we need to create a new test in authentication testing'''<br>
2) Are "OWASP-AUTHN-009 : Password Structure" and "OWASP-AUTHN-010 : Blank Passwords" as they were in v1 fully covered by OWASP-AT-003 & OWASP-AT-001? '''--> Yes'''<br>
3) Are all 5 AUTHSM references as they were in v1 fully covered by "OWASP-SM-001 : Session Management Schema"?<br>
4) What does "OWASP-DP-001 : Sensitive Data in HTML" fall under in v2/v3?<br>
5) Are all the SSL Data protection references (DP-003 through DP-007) from v1 fall under "OWASP-IG-005 : SSL/TLS Testing"?<br>
6) Is "OWASP-DS-001 : Locking Customer Accounts" a subset of AUTHN-008 in v1 or AT-006 in v2 or is it really an item on it's own?<br>
7) Are "OWASP-EH-002 : User Error Messages" and "OWASP-EH-001 : Application Error Messages" as they were in v1 meant to fall under "OWASP-IG-004 : Analysis of Error Codes"? If so where would things like overly specific authentication errors appear in the report? (If I understand correctly Information gathering isn't going to be reported) [This would be things like errors messages which actually specify "invalid username" or "invalid password" instead of "Error: the credentials provided are invalid" or similar generic messaging.] '''--> yes'''<br>
