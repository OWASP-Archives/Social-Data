The Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is an easy to use integrated penetration testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications. 

It is designed to be used by people with a wide range of security experience and as such is ideal for developers and functional testers who are new to penetration testing. 

ZAP provides automated scanners as well as a set of tools that allow you to find security vulnerabilities manually.

===OWASP ZAP is also the [http://holisticinfosec.blogspot.com/2012/02/2011-toolsmith-tool-of-year-owasp-zap.html Toolsmith Tool of the Year for 2011!]===
