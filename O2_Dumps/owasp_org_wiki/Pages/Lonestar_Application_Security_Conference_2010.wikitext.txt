== Technical Track ==
'''<font color=red>James Flom</font>'''<br>
'''<font color=brown>[http://www.owasp.org/images/6/68/LASCON2010_Flom.pdf Why ha.ckers.org Doesn’t Get Hacked]</font>'''<br>
<br>
Ha.ckers.org has suffered nearly every attack a website can.  These attacks include robots, sophisticated web-based attacks, brute force, denial of service, and network based attacks.  This speech will explain the other side of protecting high risk websites - the configurations, operating system, and network.<br>
<br>
'''<font color=red>Charles Henderson and Garrett Held</font>'''<br>
'''<font color=brown>Anatomy of a Logic Flaw</font>'''<br>
<br>
Traditional vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, buffer overflows, etc, have well established techniques for discovery and prevention. On the other hand, logic flaws are incredibly diverse and often unique to the specific application or business organization. Because of this, logic flaws have taken on a near mythical status. In the myth, logic flaws are nearly impossible to find until the elite of the elite hackers launch an attack to completely own the application.  The reality is far different; logic flaws are not the complex nightmare that many have made them out to be. This presentation will use real-world examples to show how logic flaws are typically introduced into an application, how they can be consistently detected during testing, and how they can be prevented during development. Instead of hoping for magic, repeatable processes will be outlined for each of those items. This will prove beneficial to anyone responsible for application security: programmers, architects, managers, and pen testers.<br>
<br>
'''<font color=red>Chris Eng</font>'''<br>
'''<font color=brown>[http://www.owasp.org/images/0/05/LASCON2010_Eng.pdf Deconstructing ColdFusion]</font>'''<br>
<br>
ColdFusion is a somewhat forgotten but still very prevalent web application development platform. This presentation is a technical survey of ColdFusion security that will be of interest mostly to code auditors, penetration testers, and developers.  In the talk, we'll cover the history of the ColdFusion platform and its relevance to today's security landscape.   We'll describe basics of ColdFusion markup, control flow, functions, and components and demonstrate how to identify common web application vulnerabilities in the source code. We'll also delve into ColdFusion J2EE internals, showing what CFML pages and components look like when compiled down to Java, and describing some of the unusual behavior we've observed at that level. We'll discuss open-source tools to aid reverse engineers in working with ColdFusion's proprietary classfile format.<br>

'''<font color=brown>HTTPS Can Byte Me</font>'''<br>
'''Video:''' [http://vimeo.com/17822849 Link]<br>
<br>
HTTPS was created to protect confidentiality and prove integrity of content passed over the web. It has essentially become the de-facto standard for internet commerce transport security. Over the years a number of exploits have attacked the principle, underlying PKI infrastructure and overall design of HTTPS. This presentation will drive another nail in the HTTPS coffin through a number of new exploitation techniques leveraging man-in-the-middle attacks; the goal of which is to break confidentiality and integrity of HTTPS traffic. The impact of these flaws suggests a need for changes in the ways we protect the transmission of data online.<br>

'''<font color=brown>[http://www.owasp.org/images/6/61/LASCON2010_Kamkar.pdf How I Met Your Girlfriend]</font>'''<br>
'''Video:''' [http://vimeo.com/17822912 Link]<br>
<br>
How I Met Your Girlfriend: The discovery and execution of entirely new classes of attacks executed from the Web in order to meet your girlfriend. This includes newly discovered attacks inclduing HTML5 client-side XSS (without XSS hitting the server!), PHP session hijacking and weak random numbers (accurately guessing PHP session cookies), browser protocol confusion (turning a browser into an SMTP server), firewall and NAT penetration via Javascript (turning your router against you), remote iPhone Google Maps hijacking (iPhone penetration combined with HTTP man-in-the-middle), extracting extremely accurate geolocation information from a Web browser (not using IP geolocation), and more.<br>

== Management Track ==
'''<font color=red>Charlie Scott and Jay Paz</font>'''<br>
'''<font color=brown>[http://www.owasp.org/images/6/6f/LASCON2010_Scott_Paz.pdf Conducting an Instiution-Wide, Multi-Department Application Security Assessment]</font>'''<br>
<br>
From early 2009 until mid-2010, the Information Security Office at the University of Texas at Austin conducted a security assessment of over 250 web applications, spanning over 30 departments.  The objectives of this assessment were to provide a thorough security review of existing applications, and act as an education and awareness exercise for the application developers.  This presentation covers the political, technical, and scheduling challenges encountered on this assessment, how they were overcome, the results of the assessment and the changes they brought about, and lessons learned by the assessment team.<br>
<br>
'''<font color=red>Joe Jarzombek</font>'''<br>
'''<font color=brown>Mitigating Business Risks with Application Security</font>'''<br>
'''Video:''' [http://vimeo.com/17822614 Link]<br>
<br>
With today’s global IT software supply chain, project management and software/systems engineering processes must explicitly address security risks posed by exploitable software.  Traditionally, these disciplines have not clearly and directly focused on software security risks that can be passed from projects to the organization.  Software security assurance processes and practices span development and acquisition and can be used to enhance project management and quality assurance activities.  Mr. Jarzombek explains the critical need for adherence to the practices, guidelines, rules, and principles used to build security into every phase of software development.<br>
<br>
'''<font color=red>Michael Howard</font>'''<br>
'''<font color=brown>Everything useful I learned about software security, I learned at Microsoft!</font>'''<br>
'''Video:''' [http://vimeo.com/17822721 Link]<br>
<br>
In this talk, Michael will discuss some of the things he has learned over the last 10 years working on software security at Microsoft. The Wins. The Losses, but most importantly, the Wisdom learned!<br>
<br>
'''<font color=red>Erik Pace Birkholz</font>'''<br>
'''<font color=brown>[http://www.owasp.org/images/8/80/LASCON2010_Birkholz.pdf Security Religions and Risk Windows]</font>'''<br>
<br>
There is a difference between what is possible and what is probable, something we often lose sight of in the world of information security. For example, a vulnerability represents a possible way for an attacker to exploit an asset, but remember not all vulnerabilities are created equal. Obviously, we must also keep in mind that a vulnerability's mere existence does not necessarily mean it will be exploited, or indicate by whom or to what extent. Some vulnerabilities are more difficult to exploit than others and therefore attract different attackers. Autonomous worms & viruses may attack one type of issue, while a sentient targeted attacker may prefer another path. Better understanding of these factors enables us to make informed business decisions about website risk management and what is probable.<br>
<br>
'''<font color=red>Pete Perfetti</font>'''<br>
'''<font color=brown>[http://www.owasp.org/images/b/b7/LASCON2010_Perfetti.pdf Technology and Business Risk Management: How Application Security Fits In]</font>'''<br>
<br>
This presentation demonstrates how important application security is to the overall stability and security of the infrastructure and the ultimately, the business. Presented from the Information Security Officer/Risk Manager point of view, it shows how a strong information security program reduces levels of reputational, operational, legal, and strategic risk by limiting vulnerabilities, increasing stability, and maintaining customer confidence and trust. It focuses on the top concerns of risk managers and how application security fits into the overall risk management process. The audience will be given recommendations on how to improve cost effectiveness and efficiency to achieve business, security, audit, and compliance objectives relative to applications.<br>
<br>

== OWASP Etc Track ==
'''<font color=red>Dean Bushmiller</font>'''<br>
'''<font color=brown>[http://www.owasp.org/images/6/63/LASCON2010_Bushmiller.pdf OWASP Top 10: What is it all about?]</font>'''<br>
<br>
Everyone knows exactly what the OWASP top ten security threats are, right? Well sort of... I ask people if they have heard of the top ten they say yes. I ask them to name a few they pause, then they blurt out 2-3. Then I ask them to explain those 2-3 and they look at me like a deer-in-the-headlights. I want to make sure that everyone who walks out of the presentation can clearly define the top ten and be able to communicate to another what each of the top ten vulnerabilites are.<br>
<br>
'''<font color=red>Brad Causey</font>'''<br>
'''<font color=brown>[http://www.owasp.org/images/5/55/LASCON2010_Causey.ppt Automating Web Testing Beyond OWASP Webscarab Using Python] ([http://www.owasp.org/images/3/33/LASCON2010_Causey_Python_files.zip Python Files])</font>'''<br>
<br>
This presentation will illustrate ways to improve web security assessments by using advanced features in OWASP Webscarab and extending your options with automation using Python.<br>
<br>
'''<font color=red>Noa Bar-yosef</font>'''<br>
'''<font color=brown>[http://www.owasp.org/images/7/7f/LASCON2010_BarYosef.pdf Tell Me Your IP and I Will Tell You Who You Are]</font>'''<br>
<br>
IP addresses have been traditionally considered an unreliable method for attack detection. The unreliability is attributed to the use of web proxies, NAT       and non-static IP addresses for end-stations. This session will demonstrate how information derived from IP addresses can in fact be used to dramatically       improve attack detection capabilities. The presentation will discuss attributes such as Geo Location, Reverse DNS Lookup, Anonymous Proxy lists and more. We    discuss how IP intelligence can be used to increase detection effectiveness (ratio of false positives to false negatives) by "ruling" on otherwise      indecisive anomalies. We also discuss certain scenarios in which IP intelligence is crucial for even detecting anomalies. The presentation is supported by corroborative evidence derived from actual log data and demonstrates some of the tools that can be used for analysis.<br>

'''<font color=red>Karen Lu and Asad Ali</font>'''<br>
'''<font color=brown>[http://www.owasp.org/images/5/5b/LASCON2010_Lu_Ali.pdf Enhancing Web Application Security Using another Factor]</font>'''<br>
<br>
As web applications have become a necessity of contemporary societies, there is an increasing need to secure access to these applications. This talk explains how web applications can add the "what-you-have" factor to strengthen user authentication and enhance the security, without compromising the ease of use generally associated with the traditional username/password method. In particular, we will describe smart card based authentication methods, including OTP, TLS mutual authentication, and X.509 certificate-based challenge/response. Although these methods have their strengths and weaknesses in terms ofsecurity and usability, they all significantly enhance the authentication for web applications.<br>
<br>
'''<font color=red>Ernest Mueller</font>'''<br>
'''<font color=brown>[http://www.owasp.org/images/c/c5/LASCON2010_Mueller.pdf Why The Cloud Is More Secure Than Your Existing Systems]</font>'''<br>
<br>
Security is frequently cited as the #1 hindrance to the adoption of cloud computing. Much of this concern is generated by the fact that security is frequently cited as the #1 hindrance to the adoption of cloud computing. Come cut through the FUD and hear about ways in that cloud systems are actually way more secure than what you already have running in your enterprise, and how you as a security professional can benefit from the cloud when creating secure systems.<br>
