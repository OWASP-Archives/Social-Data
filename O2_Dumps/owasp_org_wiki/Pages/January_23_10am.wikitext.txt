1. Discussion if Wayne would be assisting with either OWASP Asia 2009 conference or Taipei Conference 2009
	- Is there an issue if the conference is around the same date as the US conference?
	- Wayne mentions that having speakers near the same time as another conference, it's better for the "freshness" of the content
	- Potentially in October/November 2009


2. Given the current economic climate, does it make sense to partner with another organization (eg. ISSA) to host a conference?
	- OWASP usually has certain requirements (use the OWASP template, etc.)
	- Can give OWASP more exposure to a different audience
	- Can bring different types of speakers
	- OWASP should have some guidelines regarding partnerships

3. It's important that OWASP come up with some financial / revenue goals for conferences

4. The 2009 Goals are approved by the committee by EOD 01/23/09 - Approval from Wayne and Dhruv pending.
	- To establish standard guidelines for conference chairs to follow when planning events.
	- Identify budget guidelines for conference chairs to follow.
	- Create a sponsorship package.
	- Map our conferences plan for 2009.
	- Create "speaker pool" with availability and location.
	- Examine current conference planning tool (Cvent) and determine plan for 2010.

5. Mark Bristow is now an approved member of the Committee.

6. Tentative date / time set for next meeting is 02/06/2009 10am Eastern time. Wayne requests after 2pm Eastern on Fridays, does that conflict with Dhruv's schedule?
