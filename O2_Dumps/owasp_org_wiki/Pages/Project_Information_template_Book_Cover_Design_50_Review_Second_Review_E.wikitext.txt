1. At what extent have the project deliveries & objectives been accomplished?  Having in consideration [[OWASP Summer of Code 2008 Applications#OWASP Book Cover & Sleeve Design|'''the assumed ones''']], please exemplify writing down those of them that haven't been realised.
 | colspan="2" style="width:75%; background:#cccccc" align="left"|The initial book cover designs have been released. I believe they suit the purpose and a standardised cover for all releases is important. The OWASP logo could be included on the books. The OWASP colouring (blue) is not present. (observation). The book covers are of a high standard and have a professional feel. I have not reviewed the sleeves/box to date 21/7
