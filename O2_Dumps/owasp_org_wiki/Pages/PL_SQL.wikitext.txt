PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language) is Oracle Corporation's proprietary procedural extension to the SQL database language. Some other SQL database management systems offer similar extensions to the SQL language. PL/SQL's syntax strongly resembles that of Ada.

The key strength of PL/SQL is its tight integration with the Oracle database.

PL/SQL is one of three languages embedded in the Oracle Database, the other two being SQL and Java.

* [[PL/SQL:SQL Injection]]
* [[PL/SQL:Cursor Injection]]
* [[PL/SQL:Dangling Cursor Snarfing]]
* [[PL/SQL:Buffer overflow]]
* [[PL/SQL:Privilege escalation]]
