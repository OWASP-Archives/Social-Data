== '''<br><br>Abstract: Database Security in the Real World'''<br> ==

This presentation will provide an overview of the common threats and vectors that are leveraged by real world attackers to gain unauthorized access to high value databases. It is well understood that high value databases support critical applications and store sensitive information, but they can also be used to escalate privileges in Windows environments and propagate botnets across the internet. This presentation will provide developers and system administrators with a better understanding of how those attacks are conducted.<br>
