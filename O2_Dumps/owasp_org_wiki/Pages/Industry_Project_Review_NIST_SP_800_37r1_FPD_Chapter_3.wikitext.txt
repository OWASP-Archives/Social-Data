<big>'''THE PROCESS'''</big>

EXECUTING THE [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management RISK MANAGEMENT] FRAMEWORK TASKS


This chapter describes the process of applying the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management Risk Management] Framework ([http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:RMF RMF]) to federal information systems.<ref>The process for managing risk from information systems described in this publication can be tailored to meet the needs of many [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Communities_of_Interest communities of interest] within the federal government including, for example, the Civil, Defense, and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Intelligence Intelligence] Communities. [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Tailoring Tailoring] provides flexibility in applying the concepts of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:RMF RMF] in a manner that is most suitable for the organizations and the information systems involved.</ref> The process includes a set of well-defined risk-related tasks that are to be carried out by selected individuals or groups within the organization (e.g., [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)], [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official], [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official_Designated_Representative authorizing official designated representative], [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Chief_Information_Officer chief information officer], [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Senior_Information_Security_Officer senior information security officer], enterprise architect, information security architect, information owner/steward, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner], [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider], [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Security_Officer information system security officer], and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Control_Assessor security control assessor]). The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:RMF RMF] extends beyond the organization to external providers (e.g., providers of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] in external environments). Each [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:RMF RMF] task description includes the individual or group with the primary responsibility for carrying out the task, the supporting roles that may be called upon to assist in completing the task, the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Development_Life_Cycle system development life cycle] phase most closely associated with the task, supplemental guidance to help explain how the task is executed, and appropriate [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:References references] for publications or Web sites with information related to the task.

The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:RMF RMF] tasks can be applied at appropriate phases in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Development_Life_Cycle system development life cycle]. While the tasks appear in sequential order, there can be many points in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] process that require divergence from the sequential order. For example, the results from security control assessments can trigger [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Remediation remediation] actions on the part of an [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner], which can in turn require the reassessment of selected controls. Monitoring the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] in an information system can also generate a potential cycle of tracking changes to the system and its environment of operation, conducting security impact analyses, taking [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Remediation remediation] actions, reassessing [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls], and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Reporting reporting] the security status of the system. There may also be other opportunities to diverge from the sequential nature of the tasks when it is more efficient or cost-effective to do so. For example, while the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Control_Assessment security control assessment] tasks are listed after the security control implementation tasks, some organizations may choose to begin the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] of certain controls as soon as they are implemented but prior to the complete implementation of all controls described in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan]. This may result in the organization assessing the physical and environmental protection controls within a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Facility facility] prior to assessing the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] employed in the hardware and software components of the information system (which may be implemented at a later time).

The process of implementing the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:RMF RMF] tasks (i.e., the order and manner in which the tasks occur and are executed, the names of primary/supporting roles, the names and format of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Artifacts artifacts]) may vary from organization to organization. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Categorization security categorization] process influences the level of effort expended when implementing the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:RMF RMF]. Information systems supporting the most critical and/or sensitive operations and assets within the organization as indicated by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Categorization security categorization] process, demand the greatest level of attention and effort to ensure that appropriate information security and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Mitigation risk mitigation] are achieved. A summary table of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:RMF RMF] tasks is provided in Appendix E.


{{GIC-NISTSP80037r1FPDGreyBox
| Title=APPLICATION OF THE [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management RISK MANAGEMENT] FRAMEWORK
| Text=The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management Risk Management] Framework and associated [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:RMF RMF] tasks apply to both '''''information system owners''''' and '''''common control providers'''''. In addition to supporting the authorization of information systems, the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:RMF RMF] tasks support the selection, development, implementation, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment], authorization, and ongoing monitoring of common controls inherited by organizational information systems. Execution of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:RMF RMF] tasks by [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control common control] providers, both internal and external to the organization, helps to ensure that the security capabilities provided by the common controls can be inherited by information system owners with a known degree of assurance. This approach recognizes the importance of security control effectiveness within information systems and the infrastructure supporting those systems.

Since the tasks in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:RMF RMF] are described in a '''''sequential''''' manner, organizations may choose to deviate from that sequential structure in order to be consistent with their established management and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Development_Life_Cycle system development life cycle] processes or to achieve more cost-effective and efficient solutions with regard to the execution of the tasks. Regardless of the task ordering, the last step before an information system is placed into operation is the explicit [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Acceptance acceptance] of risk by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official]. Organizations may also execute certain [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:RMF RMF] tasks in an iterative manner or in different phases of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Development_Life_Cycle system development life cycle]. For example, security control assessments may be carried out during system development, system implementation, and system operations/maintenance (as part of continuous monitoring).

Organizations may also choose to expend a greater '''''level of effort''''' on certain [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:RMF RMF] tasks and commit fewer resources to other tasks based on the level of maturity of selected processes and activities within the organization. Since the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:RMF RMF] is [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Life_Cycle life cycle] based, there will be a need to revisit various tasks over time depending on how the organization manages changes to the information systems and the environments in which those systems operate. Managing information security-related risks for an information system is viewed as part of a larger enterprise-wide [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Activity activity] that must be carried out by senior leaders. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:RMF RMF] must simultaneously provide a disciplined and structured approach to mitigating risks from the operation and use of organizational information systems and the flexibility and agility to support the core missions and business operations of the organization in highly dynamic environments of operation.

| SDLCPhase=System Initiation (concept/requirements definition).
| SGuidance=The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Categorization security categorization] process is carried out by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner] and information owner/steward in cooperation and collaboration with appropriate organizational officials (i.e., senior leaders with mission/business function and/or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] responsibilities). The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Categorization security categorization] process is conducted as an organization-wide [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Activity activity] taking into consideration the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Enterprise_Architecture enterprise architecture] and the information security [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Architecture architecture]. This helps to ensure that individual information systems are categorized based on the mission and business objectives of the organization. The results of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Categorization security categorization] process influence the selection of appropriate [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] for the information system and also the minimum assurance requirements for that system. The organization may consider decomposing the information system into multiple subsystems to more efficiently and effectively allocate [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] to the system. One approach is to categorize each identified [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Subsystem subsystem] (including dynamic subsystems). Separately categorizing each [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Subsystem subsystem] does not change the overall categorization of the information system. Rather, it allows the constituent subsystems to receive a separate allocation of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] from [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:NIST_Special_Publication_800-53 NIST Special Publication 800-53] instead of deploying higher impact controls across every [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Subsystem subsystem]. Another approach is to bundle smaller subsystems into larger subsystems within the information system, categorize each of the aggregated subsystems, and allocate [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] to the subsystems, as appropriate. [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Categorization Security categorization] information is documented in the system identification section of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan] or included as an attachment to the plan. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)] provides guidance and relevant information to authorizing officials concerning the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] strategy for the organization (e.g., [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Assessment risk assessment] methodologies employed by the organization, evaluation of risks determined, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Mitigation risk mitigation] approaches, organizational [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Tolerance risk tolerance], approaches for monitoring risk over time, known existing aggregated risks from current information systems, and other sources of risk). [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Categorization Security categorization] determinations consider potential adverse impacts to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.

[http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Registration Registration], either formal or informal in accordance with organizational policy, uses information in the system identification section of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan] to inform the parent or governing organization of: (i) the existence of the information system; (ii) the key characteristics of the system; and (iii) any security implications for the organization due to the ongoing operation of the system. Information system [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Registration registration] provides organizations with an effective management/tracking tool that is necessary for security status [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Reporting reporting] in accordance with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, guidance, or regulations. Those subsystems that are more dynamic in nature (e.g., subsystems in [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Net-Centric net-centric] [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Architectures architectures]) may not be present throughout all phases of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Development_Life_Cycle system development life cycle]. For such subsystems, it may not be possible to complete all [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Registration registration] information.

| SDLCPhase=System Initiation (requirements definition).
| SGuidance=The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] are selected based on the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Categorization security categorization] of the information system. The selection process includes, as appropriate: (i) [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Tailoring tailoring] the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Baseline_Security baseline security] controls by applying scoping, parameterization, and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Compensating_Control compensating control] guidance; (ii) supplementing the tailored [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Baseline_Security baseline security] controls, if necessary, with additional controls or control enhancements to address unique organizational needs based on a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Assessment risk assessment] (either formal or informal) and local conditions including environment of operation, organization-specific [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Requirements security requirements], specific threat information, cost-benefit analyses, or special circumstances; and (iii) specifying minimum assurance requirements. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan] contains an overview of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Requirements security requirements] for the information system in sufficient detail to determine that the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] selected would meet those requirements. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan], in addition to the list of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] to be implemented, describes the intended application of each control in the context of the information system with sufficient detail to enable a compliant implementation of the control. During the security control selection process organizations may begin planning for the continuous monitoring process by developing a monitoring strategy. The strategy can include, for example, monitoring criteria such as the volatility of specific [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] and the appropriate frequency of monitoring specific controls. Organizations may choose to address security control volatility and frequency of monitoring during control selection as inputs to the continuous monitoring process. The monitoring strategy can be included in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan] to support the concept of near [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Real-Time real-time] [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] and ongoing authorization. Information system owners inheriting common controls can either list the controls in their respective security plans or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Reference reference] the controls contained in the security plans of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control common control] providers (see Task 2.2). Information system owners can refer to the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] packages prepared by [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control common control] providers when making determinations regarding the adequacy of common controls inherited by their respective systems.

For [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Net-Centric net-centric] [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Architectures architectures] where subsystems may be added or removed from an information system dynamically, the organization includes in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan] for the system: (i) descriptions of the functions of the dynamic subsystems; (ii) the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] employed in the subsystems; (iii) constraints/assumptions regarding the functions of the dynamic subsystems and the associated [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] in the subsystems; ([http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:IV iv]) dependencies of other subsystems on the proper functioning of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] of the dynamic subsystems; (v) procedures for determining that the dynamic subsystems conform to the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan], assumptions, and constraints; and (vi) the impact of the dynamic subsystems and associated [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] on existing [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] in the information system. While inclusion of a dynamic [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Subsystem subsystem] may impact the information system or some of the currently identified subsystems, it does not necessarily mean the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Subsystem subsystem] will impact the security of the system or other subsystems. That is, not all subsystems are security relevant. Changes in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Net-Centric net-centric] [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Architectures architectures] that exceed the anticipated limits of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan] may not be allowed or may require reassessment prior to being approved. When [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] are designated as common controls, the organization ensures that sufficient information is available to information system owners and authorizing officials to support the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] process. When [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Services security services] are provided by external providers (e.g., through contracts, interagency agreements, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Lines_of_Business lines of business] arrangements, licensing agreements, and/or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Supply_Chain supply chain] exchanges), the organization: (i) defines the external services provided to the organization; (ii) describes how the external services are [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Protected protected] in accordance with the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Requirements security requirements] of the organization; and (iii) obtains the necessary assurances that the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation arising from the use of the external services is acceptable. The organization also considers that replicated subsystems within a large and complex information system (or system of systems) may exhibit common vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a common [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Threat_Source threat source], thereby negating the redundancy that might be relied upon as a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Mitigation risk mitigation] measure. The impact due to a security incident against one constituent [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Subsystem subsystem] might cascade and impact many subsystems at the same time.

[http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control Common control] providers may also be information system owners when the common controls are resident within an information system. Organizations determine the appropriate baseline (low, moderate, or high) for common controls inherited by information systems within the organization. The organization consults information system owners inheriting common controls when considering baseline selection to ensure that the security capability provided by the controls is sufficient to deliver adequate protection. When employing common controls in information systems with higher baselines than those of the common controls, information system owners supplement the common controls with system-specific or hybrid controls to achieve the required protection for the system and/or accept greater risk. Information system owners inheriting common controls can either list the controls in their respective security plans or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Reference reference] the controls contained in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan] of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider]. Organizations may choose to defer [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control common control] identification and security control selection until later in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Development_Life_Cycle system development life cycle]. When common controls are not resident within an information system (e.g., physical and environmental protection controls, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Personnel_Security personnel security] controls), the organization selects one or more senior organizational officials or executives to serve as authorizing officials for those controls. These authorizing officials are responsible for accepting the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation resulting from the deployment of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] provided by [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control common control] providers and inherited by organizational information systems. [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control Common control] providers are responsible for: (i) documenting common controls and associated baseline in a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan] (or equivalent document prescribed by the organization); (ii) ensuring that common controls are developed, implemented, and assessed for effectiveness by qualified assessors with a level of independence required by the organization; (iii) documenting [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment_Findings assessment findings] in a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:security_assessment_report security assessment report]; ([http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:IV iv]) producing a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Plan_of_Action_and_Milestones plan of action and milestones] for all common controls deemed less than effective (i.e., having unacceptable weaknesses or deficiencies in the controls); (v) receiving authorization for the common controls from the designated [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official]; and (vi) monitoring [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control common control] effectiveness on an ongoing basis.

Security plans, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Assessment security assessment] reports, and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Plans_of_Action_and_Milestones plans of action and milestones] for common controls (or a summary of such information) are made available to information system owners (whose systems are inheriting the controls) after the information is reviewed and approved by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Senior_Official senior official] or executive responsible and accountable for the controls. The organization ensures that [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control common control] providers keep this information current since the controls typically support multiple organizational information systems. Security plans, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Assessment security assessment] reports, and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Plans_of_Action_and_Milestones plans of action and milestones] for common controls are used by authorizing officials within the organization to make risk-based decisions in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] process for their information systems. The use of common controls is documented within the security plans for information systems inheriting those controls. However, that information is inadequate when [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control common control] providers have to rapidly [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Broadcast broadcast] changes in the status of common controls that negatively effects the protections being provided by and expected of the common controls. For this reason, the organization maintains records of the specific common controls used in each organizational information system. This enables [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control common control] providers to rapidly inform information system owners when problems arise in the inherited common controls (e.g., when an [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] or reassessment of a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control common control] indicates the control is flawed in some manner, when a new threat or attack method arises that renders the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control common control] less than adequate in protecting against the new threat or attack method). If common controls are provided to the organization (and its information systems) by entities external to the organization (e.g., shared and/or external service providers), arrangements are made with the external/shared service providers by the organization to obtain information on the effectiveness of the deployed controls. Information obtained from external organizations regarding the effectiveness of common controls is factored into authorization decisions.

| SDLCPhase=System Initiation (concept/requirements definition).
| SGuidance=A critical aspect of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] is the ongoing monitoring of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] employed within or inherited by the information system. An effective monitoring strategy is developed early in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Development_Life_Cycle system development life cycle] (i.e., during system design or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:COTS COTS] [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Procurement procurement] decision) and can be included in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan]. The implementation of a robust continuous monitoring program allows an organization to understand the security state of the information system over time and maintain the initial [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] in a highly dynamic environment of operation with changing threats, vulnerabilities, technologies, and missions/business functions. The ongoing monitoring of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] using automated tools and supporting databases facilitates near [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Real-Time real-time] [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] for the information system. An effective monitoring program includes:

*  [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Configuration_Management Configuration management] and control processes;
*  Security impact analyses on actual or proposed changes to the information system and its environment of operation;
*  [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment Assessment] of selected [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] employed within and inherited by the information system (including controls in dynamic subsystems); and
*  Security status [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Reporting reporting] to appropriate organizational officials.

The criteria for selecting [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] to be monitored post deployment and for determining the frequency of such monitoring is established by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner] or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider] in collaboration with selected organizational officials including, for example, the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] or designated representative, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Chief_Information_Officer chief information officer], [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Senior_Information_Security_Officer senior information security officer], and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)]. In many cases, the approach for monitoring [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] may be a continuation of the control assessments conducted during system development and prior to deployment. The selection criteria reflect the priorities and importance of the information system to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls Security controls] that are volatile (i.e., most likely to change over time), critical to certain aspects of the organization's protection strategy, or identified in current [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Plans_of_Action_and_Milestones plans of action and milestones] are assessed as frequently as necessary consistent with the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Criticality criticality] of the function and capability of the monitoring tools. The use of automation facilitates a greater frequency and volume of security control assessments. Determining the frequency for assessing [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] inherited by the information system (i.e., common controls) includes the organization's determination of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Trustworthiness trustworthiness] of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider]. An organizational [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] of risk (either formal or informal) can also be used to guide the selection of specific [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] to be monitored and the frequency of such monitoring.

The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] or designated representative and the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Senior_Information_Security_Officer senior information security officer] approve the monitoring strategy including the set of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] that are to be monitored on an ongoing basis as well as the frequency of the monitoring activities. The approval of the monitoring strategy can be obtained in conjunction with the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan] approval. The monitoring of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] continues throughout the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Development_Life_Cycle system development life cycle]. For [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] employed in information systems with dynamic subsystems, the monitoring strategy accounts for subsystems that did not exist at the beginning of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Development_Life_Cycle system development life cycle]. An effective monitoring strategy for dynamic subsystems achieves an appropriate balance with regard to risk by: (i) not placing unnecessary or unrealistic burdens on the organization by requiring reauthorization of the information system each time a new [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Subsystem subsystem] is added or removed; and (ii) not compromising the accepted security posture of the overall system.

| SDLCPhase=System Development/Acquisition; System Implementation.
| SGuidance=Security control implementation is consistent with the organization's [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Enterprise_Architecture enterprise architecture] and information security [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Architecture architecture]. The information security [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Architecture architecture] serves as a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Resource resource] to allocate [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] (including, for example, security mechanisms and services) to an information system and any organization-defined subsystems. [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls Security controls] targeted for deployment within the information system (including subsystems) are allocated to specific system components responsible for providing a particular security capability. Not all [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] need to be allocated to every [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Subsystem subsystem]. Categorization of subsystems, information security [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Architecture architecture], and allocation of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] work together to help achieve a suitable balance. Allocating some [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] as common controls or hybrid controls is part of this architectural process.

Organizations use best practices when implementing the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] within the information system including system and software engineering methodologies, security engineering principles, and secure coding techniques. In addition, organizations ensure that mandatory [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Configuration_Settings configuration settings] are established and implemented on information technology products in accordance with federal and organizational policies (e.g., [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Federal_Desktop_Core_Configuration Federal Desktop Core Configuration]). Information system security engineers with support from information system security officers employ a sound security engineering process that captures and refines information [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Requirements security requirements] and ensures their integration into information technology products and systems through purposeful security design or configuration. When available, organizations consider the use of information technology products that have been tested, evaluated, or validated by approved, independent, third-party [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Facilities facilities]. In addition, organizations satisfy minimum assurance requirements when implementing [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls]. For higher-impact systems (i.e., potential high-value targets) in situations where specific and credible threat information indicates the likelihood of advanced cyber attacks, additional assurance [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Measures measures] are considered. Organizations also consider any implementation-related issues associated with the integration and/or interfaces among common controls and system-specific controls.

For the identified common controls inherited by the information system, information system security engineers with support from information system security officers coordinate with the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider] (or their designee) to determine the most appropriate way to apply the common controls to the organizational information systems. For certain management and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Operational_Controls operational controls], formal integration into information technology products, services, and systems may not be required. For certain types of operational and/or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Technical_Controls technical controls], implementation may require additional components, products, or services to enable the information system to utilize the previously selected common controls to the fullest extent. If selection of common controls previously had been deferred, identification of common controls inherited by the information system is revisited to determine if better determinations can be made at this point in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Development_Life_Cycle system development life cycle]. For common controls that have unacceptable weaknesses or deficiencies or that are not designed for the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Categorization security categorization] associated with the information system inheriting the controls, the system owner identifies compensating or supplementary controls to be implemented.

Documentation of security control implementation allows for traceability of decisions taken prior to and after deployment of the information system. The level of effort expended on documentation of the information system is commensurate with the purpose, scope, and impact of the system with respect to organizational missions, business functions, and operations. To the extent possible, organizations [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Reference reference] existing documentation (either by vendors or other organizations that have employed the same or similar information systems), use automated support tools, and maximize communications to increase the overall efficiency and cost effectiveness of security control implementation. The documentation also addresses platform dependencies and includes any additional information necessary to describe how the security capability required by the security control is achieved at level of detail sufficient to support control [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment].

Since the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Enterprise_Architecture enterprise architecture] and information security [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Architecture architecture] established by the organization significantly influence the approach used to implement [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls], providing documentation of this process helps to ensure traceability with regard to meeting the organization's information [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Requirements security requirements].

| SGuidance=The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:security_assessment_plan security assessment plan] provides the objectives for the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Control_Assessment security control assessment] and a detailed roadmap of how to conduct such an [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] including the use of automation, where appropriate. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] plan reflects the type of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] the organization is conducting (e.g., security control assessments in support of initial information system authorizations, ongoing security control monitoring, assessments subsequent to [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Remediation remediation] actions). The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:security_assessment_plan security assessment plan] is reviewed and approved by appropriate organizational officials to ensure that the plan is consistent with the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Objectives security objectives] of the organization, employs state-of-the practice tools, techniques, procedures, and automation to support the concept of continuous monitoring and near [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Real-Time real-time] [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management], and is cost-effective with regard to the resources allocated for the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment]. The purpose of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:security_assessment_plan security assessment plan] approval is two-fold: (i) to establish the appropriate expectations for the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Control_Assessment security control assessment]; and (ii) to bound the level of effort for the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Control_Assessment security control assessment]. An approved [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:security_assessment_plan security assessment plan] helps to ensure that an appropriate level of resources is applied toward determining security control effectiveness. When [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] are provided to an organization by an external provider (e.g., through contracts, interagency agreements, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Lines_of_Business lines of business] arrangements, licensing agreements, and/or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Supply_Chain supply chain] exchanges), the organization obtains a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:security_assessment_plan security assessment plan] from the provider.

Organizations consider both the technical expertise and level of independence required in selecting security control assessors. An independent [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessor assessor] is any individual or group capable of conducting an impartial [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] employed within or inherited by an information system. Impartiality implies that assessors are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest with respect to the development, operation, and/or management of the information system or the determination of security control effectiveness. Independent [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Control_Assessment security control assessment] services can be obtained from other elements within the organization or can be contracted to a public or private sector [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Entity entity] outside of the organization. Contracted [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] services are considered independent if the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner] is not directly involved in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Contracting contracting] process or cannot unduly influence the independence of the assessor(s) conducting the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls]. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] or designated representative determines the required level of independence for security control assessors based on the results of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Categorization security categorization] process for the information system and the ultimate risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] determines if the level of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessor assessor] independence is sufficient to provide confidence that the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] results produced are sound and can be used to make a credible, risk-based decision on whether to place the information system into operation or continue its operation. In special situations, for example when the organization that owns the information system is small or the organizational structure requires that the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Control_Assessment security control assessment] be accomplished by individuals that are in the developmental, operational, and/or management chain of the system owner or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official], independence in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] process can be achieved by ensuring that the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by an independent team of experts to validate the completeness, consistency, and veracity of the results. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] consults with the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Office_of_the_Inspector_General Office of the Inspector General], the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Senior_Information_Security_Officer senior information security officer], and the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Chief_Information_Officer chief information officer] to fully discuss the implications of any decisions on [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessor assessor] independence in the types of special circumstances described above.

Organizations also ensure that security control assessors possess the required technical skills and expertise to successfully carry out assessments of system-specific, hybrid, and common controls. This includes knowledge of and experience with the specific hardware, software, and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Firmware firmware] components employed by the organization to host [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Technical_Controls technical controls] (e.g., [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Access_Controls access controls], auditing and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Accountability accountability] controls, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Identification_and_Authentication identification and authentication] controls, system and communications protection controls).

| SDLCPhase=System Implementation.
| SGuidance=Security control assessments determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Requirements security requirements] for the information system. Security control assessments occur as early as practicable in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Development_Life_Cycle system development life cycle], preferably during the development phase of the information system. These types of assessments are referred to as developmental testing and evaluation and are intended to validate that the required [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] are implemented correctly and consistent with the established information security [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Architecture architecture]. Security weaknesses and deficiencies identified early in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Development_Life_Cycle system development life cycle] can be resolved more quickly and in a much more cost effective manner before proceeding to subsequent phases in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Life_Cycle life cycle]. The objective is to identify the information security [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Architecture architecture] and [http://fismapedecurity_Controls security controls] employed within or inherited by the information system using [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] procedures specified in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:security_assessment_plan security assessment plan]; and (ii) provide specific recommendations on how to correct weaknesses or deficiencies in the controls and reduce or eliminate identified vulnerabilities. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessor assessor] findings are an [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Unbiased unbiased], factual [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Reporting reporting] of the weaknesses and deficiencies discovered during the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Control_Assessment security control assessment]. Organizations are strongly encouraged to maximize the use of automation to conduct security control assessments to help: (i) increase the speed and overall effectiveness and efficiency of the assessments; and (ii) support the concept of ongoing monitoring of the security state of organizational information systems. When iterative development processes such as agile development are employed, this typically results in an iterative [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] as each cycle is conducted. A similar process is used for assessing [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] in [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:COTS COTS] information technology products employed within the information system. Even when iterative development is not employed, organizations may choose to begin assessing [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] prior to the complete implementation of all [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] listed in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan]. This type of incremental [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] is allowed if it is more efficient or cost-effective to do so. For example, policy, procedures, and plans may be assessed prior to the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Technical_Security technical security] controls in the hardware and software. In many cases, common controls (i.e., [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] inherited by the information system) may be assessed prior to the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] employed within the system.

The organization ensures that the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessor assessor] has access to: (i) the information system and environment of operation where the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] are employed; and (ii) the appropriate documentation, records, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Artifacts artifacts], test results, and other materials needed to assess the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls]. When [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] are provided to an organization by an external provider (e.g., through contracts, interagency agreements, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Lines_of_Business lines of business] arrangements, licensing agreements, and/or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Supply_Chain supply chain] exchanges), the organization ensures that assessors have access to the information system/environment of operation where the controls are employed as well as appropriate information needed to carry out the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment]. The organization also obtains any information related to existing assessments that may have be conducted by the external provider and reuses such [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] information whenever possible in accordance with the reuse criteria established by the organization. Descriptive information about the information system is typically documented in the system identification section of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan] or, in some cases, included by [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Reference reference] or as attachments to the plan. Supporting materials such as procedures, reports, logs, and records showing evidence of security control implementation are identified as well. In order to make the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] process as timely and cost-effective as possible, the reuse of previous [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] results, when reasonable and appropriate, is strongly recommended. For example, a recent audit of an information system may have produced information about the effectiveness of selected [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls]. Another opportunity to reuse previous [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] results comes from programs that test and evaluate the security features of commercial information technology products. And finally, if prior [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] results from the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Developer system developer] are available, the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Control_Assessor security control assessor], under appropriate circumstances, may incorporate those results into the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment].

The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:security_assessment_report security assessment report] is one of three key documents in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] package developed for authorizing officials. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] report includes information from the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessor assessor] necessary to determine the effectiveness of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] employed within or inherited by the information system based upon the assessor's findings. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:security_assessment_report security assessment report] is an important factor in an authorizing official's determination of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Control_Assessment Security control assessment] results are documented at a level of detail appropriate for the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] in accordance with the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Reporting reporting] format prescribed by organizational and/or federal policies. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Reporting reporting] format is also appropriate for the type of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Control_Assessment security control assessment] conducted (e.g., self-assessments, independent [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Verification verification] and validation, independent assessments supporting the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] process, or independent audits/evaluations). [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Control_Assessment Security control assessment] results obtained during system development are brought forward in an interim report and included in the final [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:security_assessment_report security assessment report]. This supports the concept that the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:security_assessment_report security assessment report] is an evolving document that includes [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] results from all relevant phases of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Development_Life_Cycle system development life cycle] including the results generated during continuous monitoring. Organizations may choose to develop an executive summary from the detailed findings that are generated during a [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Control_Assessment security control assessment].

| SGuidance=The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:security_assessment_report security assessment report] provides visibility into specific weaknesses and deficiencies in the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] employed within or inherited by the information system that could not reasonably be resolved during system development. The findings generated during the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Control_Assessment security control assessment] facilitate a disciplined and structured approach to mitigating risks in accordance with organizational priorities. Information system owners and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control common control] providers, in collaboration with selected organizational officials (e.g., [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Security_Engineer information system security engineer], [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official_Designated_Representative authorizing official designated representative], [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Chief_Information_Officer chief information officer], [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Senior_Information_Security_Officer senior information security officer], information owner/steward), may decide that certain findings are inconsequential and present no significant risk to the organization. Alternatively, the organizational officials may decide that certain findings are in fact, significant, requiring [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Immediate immediate] [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Remediation remediation] actions. In all cases, organizations review [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessor assessor] findings and determine the severity or seriousness of the findings (i.e., the potential adverse impact on organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation) and whether the findings are sufficiently significant to be worthy of further investigation or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Remediation remediation]. An updated [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] of risk based on the results of the findings produced during the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Control_Assessment security control assessment] and any inputs from the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)], helps to determine the initial [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Remediation remediation] actions and the prioritization of such actions. Senior leadership involvement in the mitigation process may be necessary in order to ensure that the organization's resources are effectively allocated in accordance with organizational priorities, providing resources [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:FIRST first] to the information systems that are supporting the most critical and sensitive missions and business functions for the organization or correcting the deficiencies that pose the greatest degree of risk. If weaknesses or deficiencies in [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] are corrected, the remediated controls are reassessed for effectiveness. Security control assessments determine the extent to which the remediated controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Requirements security requirements] for the information system. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan] is updated based on the findings of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Control_Assessment security control assessment] and any [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Remediation remediation] actions taken. The updated [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan] reflects the actual state of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] after the initial [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] and any modifications by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner] or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider] in addressing recommendations for corrective actions. At the completion of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment], the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan] contains an accurate list and description of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] implemented (including [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Compensating_Controls compensating controls]) and a list of residual vulnerabilities.

Organizations can prepare an optional addendum to the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:security_assessment_report security assessment report] that is transmitted to the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official]. The optional addendum provides information system owners and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control common control] providers an opportunity to respond to the initial findings of assessors. The addendum may include, for example, information regarding initial [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Remediation remediation] actions taken by information system owners or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control common control] providers in response to [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessor assessor] findings, or provide an owner's perspective on the findings (e.g., including additional explanatory [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Material material], rebutting certain findings, and correcting the record). The addendum to the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:security_assessment_report security assessment report] does not change or influence in any manner, the initial [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessor assessor] findings provided in the original report. Information provided in the addendum is considered by authorizing officials in their risk-based authorization decisions. Organizations may choose to employ an issue resolution process to help determine the appropriate actions to take with regard to the security control weaknesses and deficiencies identified during the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment]. Issue resolution can help address vulnerabilities and associated risk, false positives, and other factors that may provide useful information to authorizing officials regarding the security state of the information system including the ongoing effectiveness of system-specific, hybrid, and common controls. The issue resolution process can also help to ensure that only substantive items are identified and transferred to the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Plan_of_Actions_and_Milestones plan of actions and milestones].

| SDLCPhase=System Implementation.
| SGuidance=The explicit [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Acceptance acceptance] of risk is the responsibility of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] and cannot be delegated to other officials within the organization. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] considers many factors when deciding if the risk to organizational operations (including mission, function, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, is acceptable. Balancing security considerations with mission and operational needs is paramount to achieving an acceptable authorization decision. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] issues an authorization decision for the information system and the common controls inherited by the system after reviewing all of the relevant information and, where appropriate, consulting with key organizational officials, including the organization's [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)]. [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization Security authorization] decisions are based on the content of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] package and, where appropriate, any inputs received from key organizational officials, including the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)]. The authorization package provides relevant information on the security state of the information system including the ongoing effectiveness of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] employed within or inherited by the system. Inputs from the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)], including previously established overarching risk guidance to authorizing officials, provide additional organization-wide information to the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] that may be relevant and affect the authorization decision (e.g., organizational [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Tolerance risk tolerance], specific mission and business requirements, dependencies among information systems, and other types of risks not directly associated with the information system). [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) Risk executive (function)] inputs are documented and become part of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] decision. [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization Security authorization] decisions, including inputs from the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)], are conveyed to information system owners and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control common control] providers and made available to interested parties within the organization (e.g., information system owners and authorizing officials for interconnected systems, chief information officers, information owners/stewards, senior managers).

The authorization decision document transmits the final [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] decision from the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] to the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner] or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider], and other key organizational officials, as appropriate. The authorization decision document contains the following information:

*  Authorization decision;
*  Terms and conditions for the authorization; and
*  [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorization_termination_date Authorization termination date] (if applicable).

The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] decision indicates to the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner] whether the system is: (i) authorized to operate; or (ii) not authorized to operate. The terms and conditions for the authorization provide a description of any specific limitations or restrictions placed on the operation of the information system or inherited controls that must be followed by the system owner or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider]. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:authorization_termination_date authorization termination date], established by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official], indicates when the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] expires. Organizations may choose to eliminate the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:authorization_termination_date authorization termination date] if the continuous monitoring program is sufficiently robust to provide the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] with the needed information to conduct ongoing risk determination and risk [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Acceptance acceptance] activities with regard to the security state of the information system and the ongoing effectiveness of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] employed within and inherited by the system. However, organizational policies regarding ongoing authorization and formal reauthorization, if required, must be consistent with federal directives, regulations, and/or policies.

The authorization decision document is attached to the original [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] package containing the supporting documentation and transmitted to the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner] or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider]. Upon receipt of the authorization decision document and original authorization package, the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner] or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider] accepts the terms and conditions of the authorization. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] documents the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Acceptance acceptance] of the terms and conditions of the authorization. The organization ensures that authorization documents for both information systems and for common controls are made available to appropriate organizational officials (e.g., information system owners inheriting common controls, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)], chief information officers, senior information security officers, information system security officers). Authorization documents, especially information dealing with information system vulnerabilities, are: (i) marked and appropriately [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Protected protected] in accordance with federal and organizational policies; and (ii) retained in accordance with the organization's record retention policy. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] verifies, on an ongoing basis, that the terms and conditions established as part of the authorization are being followed by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner] or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider].

| SGuidance=Information systems are in a constant state of change with upgrades to hardware, software, or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Firmware firmware] and modifications to the surrounding environments where the systems reside and operate. A disciplined and structured approach to managing, controlling, and documenting changes to an information system or its environment of operation is an essential element of an effective security control monitoring program. Strict [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Configuration_Management configuration management] and control processes are established by the organization to support such monitoring activities. It is important to record any relevant information about specific changes to hardware, software, or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Firmware firmware] such as version or release numbers, descriptions of new or modified features/capabilities, and security implementation guidance. It is also important to record any changes to the environment of operation for the information system (e.g., modifications to hosting networks and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Facilities facilities], mission/business use of the system, threats), or changes to the organizational [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management] strategy. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner] and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider] use this information in assessing the potential security impact of the changes. Documenting proposed or actual changes to an information system or its environment of operation and subsequently assessing the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Potential_Impact potential impact] those changes may have on the security state of the system or the organization is an important aspect of security control monitoring and maintaining the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization security authorization] over time. Information system changes are generally not undertaken prior to assessing the security impact of such changes. Organizations are encouraged to maximize the use of automation when managing changes to the information system or its environment of operation.

Security impact analysis conducted by the organization, determines the extent to which proposed or actual changes to the information system or its environment of operation can affect or have affected the security state of the system. Changes to the information system or its environment of operation may affect the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] currently in place (including system-specific, hybrid, and common controls), produce new vulnerabilities in the system, or generate requirements for new [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] that were not needed previously. If the results of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Impact_Analysis security impact analysis] indicate that the proposed or actual changes can affect or have affected the security state of the system, corrective actions are initiated and appropriate documents revised and updated (e.g., the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan], [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:security_assessment_report security assessment report], and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Plan_of_Action_and_Milestones plan of action and milestones]). The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner] or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider] consults with appropriate organizational officials/entities (e.g., [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Configuration_Management configuration management] or control board, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Senior_Information_Security_Officer senior information security officer], [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Security_Officer information system security officer]) prior to implementing any security-related changes to the information system or its environment of operation. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] or designated representative uses the revised and updated [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:security_assessment_report security assessment report] in collaboration with the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Senior_Information_Security_Officer senior information security officer] and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)] to determine if a formal reauthorization action is necessary. Most [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Routine_Changes routine changes] to an information system or its environment of operation can be handled by the organization's continuous monitoring program, thus supporting the concept of ongoing authorization and near [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Real-Time real-time] [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management].

Organizations can use the current year's [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] results to meet the annual FISMA [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Control_Assessment security control assessment] requirement. To satisfy this requirement, organizations can draw upon the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] results from any of the following sources, including but not limited to: (i) security control assessments conducted as part of an information system authorization, ongoing authorization, or formal reauthorization, if required; (ii) continuous monitoring activities; or (iii) testing and evaluation of the information system as part of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Development_Life_Cycle system development life cycle] process or audit (provided that the testing, evaluation, or audit results are current, relevant to the determination of security control effectiveness, and obtained by assessors with the required degree of independence). Existing [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Assessment security assessment] results are reused to the extent that they are still valid and are supplemented with additional assessments as needed. Reuse of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] information is critical in achieving a cost-effective, fully integrated [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Program security program] capable of producing the needed evidence to determine the security status of the information system.

The updated [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan] reflects any modifications to [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] based on [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Mitigation risk mitigation] activities carried out by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner] or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider]. The updated [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:security_assessment_report security assessment report] reflects additional [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment assessment] activities carried out to determine security control effectiveness based on modifications to the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Plan security plan] and deployed controls. The updated plan of action and milestones: (i) reports progress made on the current outstanding items listed in the plan; (ii) addresses vulnerabilities discovered during the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Impact_Analysis security impact analysis] or security control monitoring; and (iii) describes how the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner] or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider] intends to address those vulnerabilities. The information provided by these critical updates helps to [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:RAISE raise] awareness of the current security state of the information system (and the common controls inherited by the system) thereby supporting the process of ongoing authorization and near [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Real-Time real-time] [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management].

The frequency of updates to critical [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management risk management]-related information is at the discretion of the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner], [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider], and authorizing officials in accordance with federal and organizational policies. Updates to [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Critical_Information critical information] regarding the security state of the information system (and common controls inherited by the system) are accurate and timely since the information provided influences ongoing security-related actions and decisions by authorizing officials and other senior leaders within the organization. With the use of automated support tools and effective organization-wide [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Program security program] management practices, authorizing officials are able to readily access the current security state of the information system including the ongoing effectiveness of system-specific, hybrid, and common controls. This facilitates near [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Real-Time real-time] management of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, and provides essential information for continuous monitoring and ongoing authorization.

When updating [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Critical_Information critical information] in security plans, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Assessment security assessment] reports, and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Plans_of_Action_and_Milestones plans of action and milestones], organizations ensure that the original information needed for oversight, management, and auditing purposes is not modified or destroyed. Providing an effective method of tracking changes to information over time through strict [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Configuration_Management configuration management] and control procedures (including version control) is necessary to: (i) achieve transparency in the information security activities of the organization; (ii) obtain [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Individual_Accountability individual accountability] for security-related actions; and (iii) better understand emerging trends in the organization's information [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Program security program].

| SGuidance=The results of monitoring activities are recorded and reported to the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] on an ongoing basis in accordance with the monitoring strategy. Security status [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Reporting reporting] can be: (i) event-driven (e.g., when the information system or its environment of operation changes or the system is compromised or breached); (ii) time-driven (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly); or (iii) both (event- and time-driven). Security status reports provide the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] and other senior leaders within the organization, essential information with regard to the security state of the information system including the effectiveness of deployed [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls]. Security status reports describe the ongoing monitoring activities employed by the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner] or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider]. Security status reports also address vulnerabilities in the information system and its environment of operation discovered during the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Control_Assessment security control assessment], [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Impact_Analysis security impact analysis], and security control monitoring and how the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System_Owner information system owner] or [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Common_Control_Provider common control provider] intends to address those vulnerabilities. Organizations have significant latitude and flexibility in the breadth, depth, and formality of security status reports.<ref>Security status reports can take whatever form the organization deems most appropriate. The goal is cost-effective and efficient ongoing communication with senior leaders conveying the current security state of the information system and its environment of operation with regard to organizational missions and business functions.</ref> At a minimum, security status reports summarize key changes to security plans, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Assessment security assessment] reports, and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Plans_of_Action_and_Milestones plans of action and milestones].

The frequency of security status reports is at the discretion of the organization and in accordance with federal and organizational policies. Status reports occur at appropriate intervals to transmit significant security-related information about the information system (including information regarding the ongoing effectiveness of [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls security controls] employed within and inherited by the system), but not so frequently as to generate unnecessary work. The [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official authorizing official] uses the security status reports in collaboration with the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Senior_Information_Security_Officer senior information security officer] and [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_(Function) risk executive (function)] to determine if a formal reauthorization action is necessary. Security status reports are appropriately marked, [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Protected protected], and handled in accordance with federal and organizational policies. At the discretion of the organization, security status reports can be used to help satisfy FISMA [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Reporting reporting] requirements for documenting remedial actions for any security-related weaknesses or deficiencies. Note that this status [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Reporting reporting] is intended to be ongoing, not to be interpreted as requiring the time, expense, and formality associated with the information provided for the initial [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Approval_to_Operate approval to operate]. Rather, the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Reporting reporting] is conducted in the most cost-effective manner consistent with achieving the [http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Reporting reporting] objectives.
