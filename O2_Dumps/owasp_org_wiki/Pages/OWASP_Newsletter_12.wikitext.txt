== Featured Item: OWASP AppSec Europe 2008 call for papers and refereed papers track ==

The Call for Papers for the OWASP AppSec Europe 2008 Conference is now open!  The OWASP AppSec conferences bring together application security experts and software engineers from all over the world. Industry and academia meet to discuss open problems and new solutions in application security.  The conferences offer researchers and practitioners a set of tutorials, keynotes, and invited presentations.

The conference will have the usual two tracks on application security. The first track will focus on business aspects and also provide some entry level OWASP topics. The second track wil focus on more technical and advanced OWASP topics. This year the referereed papers track will be extended to 2 days.

== Featured Project: ESAPI v1.1 ==

ESAPI v1.1 is now available!  Version 1.1 Major changes include:


1)	ESAPIFilter – Added a new class that can be put in front of most applications that handles ESAPI busywork including login, logging requests, URL access check, HTTP request validation (global rules), set no cache headers, set content type, and threadlocal cleanup.

2)	AccessReferenceMap – Added addDirectReference and removeDirectReference

3)	Authenticator – Added Request and Response ThreadLocals to allow logout from the IntrusionDetector

4)	Added “context” parameter to all validation calls so that log messages can indicate where bad data came from

5)	Encoder – Move canonicalize method from Validator to Encoder as it seems to fit with all the encoding methods better.

6)	Encryptor – Digital signature keypair is now derived from the master secret.

7)	HTTPUtilities – Add safe versions of encodeURL and encodeRedirectURL to prevent session rewriting.

8)	HTTPUtilities – Add methods to encrypt/decrypt the querystring.  Also methods to encrypt/decrypt state into a cookie.

9)	HTTPUtilities – Rename safe versions of dangerous methods in Java to all start with “safe”, like safeSendRedirect, safeSendForward, safeAddHeader, safeAddCookie, safeEncodeURL, safeSetContent.

10)	Validator – Add getValidSafeHTML method that invokes OWASP AntiSamy to clean up rich content that might contain an attack.

11)	HTTPUtilities – Added pragma nocache to the list of HTTP headers sent for setNoCacheHeaders

12)	Many minor fixes, documentation enhancements, and tweaks.
