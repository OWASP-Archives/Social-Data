 '''23 April 2012 meetup: Rethinking web-application architecture for the Cloud'''

Unless your organization is unique, not all your data is sensitive. This raises the question: should scarce security resources be used to protect 100% of your data?  The logical approach should be to build your IT infrastructure in a manner that optimizes your investments: protecting what matters while managing non-sensitive data with minimal controls.

This talk presents an architecture for building the next generation of web-applications.  This architecture allows you to leverage emerging technologies such as cloud-computing, cloud-storage and enterprise key-management Infrastructure (EKMI) to derive benefits such as lower costs, faster time-to-market and immense scalability with smaller investments – while proving compliance to PCI-DSS, HIPAA/HITECH and similar data-security regulations.  We call this "Regulatory Compliant Cloud Computing (RC3)".  Papers describing RC3 can be found on the following websites: 

IBM: http://ibm.co/rc3dw

ISSA Journal: http://bit.ly/rc3issa

InfoQ: http://bit.ly/rc3infoq

StrongAuth: http://www.strongauth.com/pdf/RC3-WebAppArch-1.2-2.pdf
