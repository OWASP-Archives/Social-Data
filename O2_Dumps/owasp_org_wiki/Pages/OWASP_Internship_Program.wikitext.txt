'''Stay tuned for information and program details on the OWASP Internship Program.''' 

----

<br> A key component to the overall success of OWASP’s mission is the ability to positively affect change and induce an atmosphere that is conducive for knowledge share and learning. 

To further the mission of the Educational Project, OWASP desires to help better prepare the future workforce when making the transition from student to employee. Therefore, we have developed this Internship program. The goal of this program is to act as a bridge between the corporate and educational communities. 

The benefits of participation for all involved are obvious. The Corporate Sponsors get a pipeline to future workers. Educational Sponsors further their mission by helping students better prepare for the real world. OWASP and the IT Security community benefit with the realization of our mission to make application security more visible. 

<br> If you are a corporate or educational organization and would like to participate in the program, please contact Peter Dean at peter.dean(at)owasp.org.
